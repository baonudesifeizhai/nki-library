# SENTINELS. The kernel is MIXED PRECISION, and which sentinel is legal depends on the

#     phase 1   src_snake ....... bfloat16   padding -inf; NaN folded to BFLOAT16_MIN
#     phase 2   sort buffers .... float32    padding FLOAT32_MIN; real -inf to NEG_INF_FLOOR
#     output    topk_values ..... bfloat16   (== inp.dtype)
# So NEG_INF_FLOOR is a FLOAT32-ONLY value despite the kernel's input and output being
# bfloat16: _clamp_sort_keys writes it from a float32 floor_tile into the float32 phase-2
# sort buffers, and it is never stored to a bfloat16 buffer. Phase 2 reloads through
# float32 (a bfloat16 -inf widens to float32 -inf exactly), clamps, then narrows once on
# the output store.

# Smallest finite bfloat16 value, used to pad snake slots that hold no real data.
BFLOAT16_MIN = -3.3895314e38  # most-negative bf16; padded slots never enter the top-k.
# Also the phase-1 NaN fold target. The asymmetry with NEG_INF_FLOOR below is forced by
# the dtype: bfloat16 has NO unrepresentable band to hide a sentinel in, so the most
# negative value phase 1 can write is this FINITE one, and it is therefore caller-visible
# (a NaN input slot comes back as BFLOAT16_MIN). That is accepted -- NaN has no ordering,
# so no correct value was available to return -- and the pairing check exempts exactly
# this substitution. Phase 2 needs no such compromise because float32 has the band.

def _clamp_sort_keys(buf, n_parts: int, width: int) -> None:
    """Raise real -inf sort keys to NEG_INF_FLOOR so they cannot alias the sort marker.

    THE DEFECT. The phase-2 descending sort marks a slot it has already consumed by
    OVERWRITING it: ``nc_match_replace8(..., imm=float("-inf"))`` replaces the matched
    value with -inf. A real -inf in the DATA is then bit-identical to a consumed slot.
    match_replace8 reports the FIRST occurrence of each value max8 selected, so once any
    pass has stamped a marker at a lower buffer position, a later pass that legitimately
    selects a real -inf matches the STALE MARKER instead of the real element and reports
    its position. That position gathers the paired snake index, so the returned index
    points at a different element than the returned value: values[i, j] is -inf while
    input[i, indices[i, j]] is some unrelated element. The index stays IN RANGE, so no
    range check and no value-set comparison can see it -- only an elementwise
    value<->index pairing check. -inf is a legitimate logit (constrained and speculative
    decoding mask disallowed tokens to -inf), so this is not garbage-in-garbage-out: the
    input is orderable and the correct answer is well defined. A sampler consuming
    (probability, token_id) at slot j emits the WRONG TOKEN, silently.

    THE FIX. Move the real data OFF the marker value, into a sort key that is ordered
    correctly against everything else it must be compared with. The phase-2 sort needs a
    strict three-level ordering, and exactly one float32 value satisfies it:

        FLOAT32_MIN  <  NEG_INF_FLOOR  <  every finite bfloat16 value
        (padding)       (real -inf)        (real data)

      - ABOVE FLOAT32_MIN, the sentinel the de-snake padding columns are memset to, so
        an unwritten padding slot still loses to real -inf. This is why the clamp must
        run BEFORE the padding memset at each call site: clamping afterwards would raise
        the padding too and collapse the two levels.
      - BELOW BFLOAT16_MIN (-3.3895e38), the most negative FINITE bfloat16, so real -inf
        still loses to every real finite value and the k-largest SET is unchanged.
      - ABOVE -inf, so it is distinguishable from the match_replace8 marker. This is the
        whole point: the marker value no longer occurs in the data, so a stale marker can
        never be mistaken for a real element.

    WHY A FLOAT32 VALUE IN A BFLOAT16 KERNEL. ``buf`` is always one of the phase-2 FLOAT32
    sort buffers (sv / masked_v / cv), never the bfloat16 phase-1 snake, so NEG_INF_FLOOR is
    representable exactly where it is written. The bfloat16 legs are the phase-1 snake and
    the output store; the reload into phase 2 widens bfloat16 -> float32 (a bfloat16 -inf
    widens to float32 -inf exactly), and the narrowing happens once, on the store. That
    single narrowing cast is not a hazard to work around -- it is the mechanism the fix
    relies on, per the next paragraph.

    WHY THIS IS NOT CALLER-VISIBLE. Raising the sort key would normally corrupt the
    returned VALUE -- trading a wrong index for a wrong value, which is no fix at all.
    It does not here, because of where NEG_INF_FLOOR sits relative to bfloat16's dynamic
    range. The kernel's returned values are bfloat16, and bfloat16 saturates to -inf for
    anything below about -3.3962e38. NEG_INF_FLOOR is -3.4028233e38, comfortably past
    that threshold, so the float32 -> bfloat16 cast on the output store maps it back to
    EXACTLY -inf -- bit-identical to the true value. The raise is visible only inside the
    float32 sort buffers and is undone by the output cast.

    This is the specific reason a floor chosen just above BFLOAT16_MIN does NOT work:
    that lands in bfloat16's FINITE range, so it survives the output cast as
    -3.3895e38 and leaks into the returned values as a value the input never contained.
    The usable window is the part of (FLOAT32_MIN, BFLOAT16_MIN) that overflows bfloat16,
    and NEG_INF_FLOOR takes the most-negative end of it -- one ULP above the padding
    sentinel -- which maximises the margin to the bfloat16 saturation threshold.

    WHY THIS IS PREDICATED AND NOT A max(). The obvious spelling, a single
    ``tensor_scalar(op0=nl.maximum, operand0=NEG_INF_FLOOR)``, is WRONG: the hardware
    maximum returns the non-NaN operand when one side is NaN, so it silently rewrites
    every NaN in the buffer to NEG_INF_FLOOR. That destroys NaN input -- measured on
    trn3, it turned 32/512 and 256/4096 NaN slots into -inf values paired with NaN
    elements, i.e. it converted a clean case into a desync. Instead build an
    ``== -inf`` predicate and write the floor only there: NaN compares equal to nothing,
    so NaN slots are left exactly as they are, and finite slots are untouched.

    The predicate also makes the clamp ORDER-INDEPENDENT with respect to the padding
    memsets, since FLOAT32_MIN is finite and never matches ``== -inf``. The call sites
    still clamp before their memset, which keeps the ordering argument above local and
    obvious rather than relying on this.

    Cost: TWO Vector ops over the [n_parts, width] sort buffer per sort tile, hoisted OUT
    of the n_pass = ceil(k/8) max8 -> match_replace8 -> gather chain (32 passes at k=256,
    each scanning the full width). The sort loop is the measured bottleneck; this adds no
    per-pass work, so it is a fixed ~2/(3*32) of the sort's op count at k=256.

    Notes:
        - Each vocab row is loaded into its 16-partition nisa.topk snake with a
          BLOCKED / contiguous DMA: partition p reads the contiguous HBM run
          inp[row, p*n_cols:(p+1)*n_cols] (free-stride 1), so snake position
          s = p + 16*c holds vocab index p*n_cols + c. The 16-partition snake
          LAYOUT is mandated by nisa.topk, but the ORDER of the placement is a
          free bijection (any order yields the same top-k value set). The blocked
          order is chosen so the load is contiguous; the alternative "snake
          position i == vocab index i" fill gives an identity remap but forces a
          transpose-on-load (.ap [[1,16],[16,n]], free-stride 16 -> non-contiguous
          per partition), which is avoided here. The returned snake-position
          indices are remapped back to vocab space on-chip before the index store.
        - 8 rows (groups of 16 partitions) are processed per nisa.topk call.
        - The hardware nisa.topk output order is not relied upon: the K values +
          paired snake-position indices are de-snaked and then sorted descending
          on-chip; the snake->vocab index remap is applied to the final k indices.
        - Two-phase structure: phase 1 runs nisa.topk per 8-row tile and
          de-snakes the K (value, index) pairs into per-row HBM buffers; phase 2
          runs the descending sort ONCE over up to 128 rows (one row per
          partition) instead of once per 8-row tile. max8 / nc_match_replace8 /
          nc_n_gather are per-partition free-dim ops, so widening the sort from
          8 to up to 128 partitions is free Vector-engine parallelism and removes
          the redundant per-tile sort passes (the measured HW bottleneck).
        - config.sorted gates only the phase-2 descending sort. When False the
          sort is skipped and the K results are compacted to [0, k) in arbitrary
          order; the value set and value<->index pairing are unchanged.

    Pseudocode:
        n_cols = ceil(V / 16)            # blocked snake free width

    # CORRECTNESS BUG (low/odd batch): the phase-1 de-snake stores to private_hbm and
    # the phase-2 reload of the SAME region were issued with dge_mode.none (descriptors
    # pre-generated out-of-band, store taken off the GpSIMD engine) AND asc_val_hbm was
    # bf16. On a PARTIAL phase-1 tile -- one with par_dim < 128 (n_rows < 8), e.g. a
    # single-row par_dim==16 tile produced by an ODD per_lnc_BxS shard -- that combo let
    # the reload RACE the store and/or the narrow-dtype strided store silently zero on
    # hardware, corrupting both values and indices. It only manifests in the fully
    # overlapped device run; the simulator and the serialized device-dump/debugger build
    # never reproduce it (every per-op SBUF dump is correct yet the device output is
    # wrong). All shards have ONLY full 128-partition tiles iff per_lnc_BxS is a multiple
    # of GROUPS_PER_TILE AND no shard is clamped (BxS == n_prgs * per_lnc_BxS); that is
    # the case for every batched/GPT-OSS shape. fast_dma_safe is that compile-time
    # predicate: when True keep the original fast path (dge_mode.none + bf16 value
    # buffer, halving the value-bounce bytes); when False (any partial/single-row tile)
    # use the proven-safe path -- default DMA mode (SWDGE keeps the store ordered with
    # its top-k producer and the reload) and a float32 value buffer (4-byte elements
    # round-trip correctly under the strided store; the reload casts bf16->f32 anyway).
    # Many-tile end of the SAME store/reload hazard the small/partial-tile case above
    # describes: under dge_mode.none the de-snake stores are unordered against their
    # consumer, and the number in flight grows as n_tiles = ceil(per_lnc_BxS / 8). An
    # end-to-end gpt-oss-120b decode run (bs4: 0/640 -> 640/640 requests) was fixed by
    # capping the unordered path at n_tiles < 8, but that cap is NOT the fix it was
    # believed to be, for two reasons found by the ordering audit:
    #
    #   1. Its stated mechanism is impossible as written. The claim was that the reload
    #      overtakes the store, so `pos` holds garbage and "the gather faults". `pos` is
    #      CLAMPED to [0, HALF-1] / [0, k_pad-1] at both nc_n_gather sites before it is
    #      ever used as a gather index, so a garbage `pos` cannot produce an
    #      out-of-bounds gather. Whatever the cap fixed, it was not that.
    #   2. It moves FIVE things at once. Because the single `fast_dma_safe` predicate was
    #      overloaded, lowering it flipped the de-snake DGE mode AND the value-buffer
    #      dtype AND three unrelated cross-engine SBUF sync gates (the valley sync, the
    #      out_i sync, and the A-half copy method). Any one of those could have been the
    #      actual repair, so the tile count is not established as the causal variable.
    #
    # The predicate is therefore SPLIT into the two independent concerns it conflated, and the
    # DGE mode is no longer one of them -- see THE STORE/RELOAD RACE IS REAL below.
    #
    # `fast_dma_safe` keeps its ORIGINAL meaning and its original definition: this
    # shard's phase-1 tiles are all full 128-partition tiles, which is what makes the
    # bf16 de-snake round trip safe against the narrow-dtype strided store. It no longer
    # selects the DGE mode. The empirical n_tiles < 8 cap stays REMOVED: it was a threshold
    # standing in for an ordering guarantee, and the ordering is now unconditional.
    fast_dma_safe = (per_lnc_BxS % GROUPS_PER_TILE == 0) and (BxS == n_prgs * per_lnc_BxS)
    # --- THE STORE/RELOAD RACE IS REAL, AND NOT CONFINED TO PARTIAL TILES ---------------
    # dge_mode.unknown UNCONDITIONALLY (it used to be dge_mode.none whenever fast_dma_safe).
    # dge_mode.none pre-generates the de-snake descriptors out-of-band and takes the store off
    # the GpSIMD engine, which is exactly why nothing then orders that store against the
    # phase-2 reload of the SAME private_hbm region. The compiler-selected mode does preserve
    # that ordering. HWDGE cannot generate the strided de-snake descriptor pattern
    # ([NCC_IBIR098]) so it is never chosen here, and an explicitly-forced SWDGE was observed
    # to STILL drop values on the par_dim==16 case -- so let the compiler pick rather than
    # pinning a mode.
    #
    # MEASURED, at 128 ranks through the GPT-OSS tail (gbs=1024, two hops, 8 rows/rank):
    # 2 of 128 row blocks returned REPEATED vocab ids with the top-k VALUES exactly right;
    # with this one line changed, all four gates pass on all 128 ranks at gbs 128, 512 AND
    # 1024. The asymmetry is the tell: values and indices ride in SEPARATE private_hbm buffers
    # (asc_val_hbm, asc_idx_hbm) of different widths, so a race can take the index buffer while
    # the value buffer lands in time -- correct values carrying wrong, typically duplicated,
    # token ids, which is the failure mode a sampler cannot detect.
    #
    # Why it hid for so long, and why a tile-count threshold could never be the fix: exposure
    # tracks how busy the DMA subsystem is when phase 1 runs, not the tile count. Standalone the
    # same reduce geometry and tie density is clean over 544 independent blocks; at 32 ranks the
    # full tail dataflow is clean over 128 blocks (its de-interleave moves 64 KB against
    # 6.4 MB at 128 ranks); and at 128 ranks gbs 128 and 512 were clean while only gbs=1024
    # failed. Same code path in every one of those -- red_rows is 8 and fast_dma_safe is True at
    # BxS 1, 4 and 8 alike -- so nothing about the shape distinguishes them. Only the amount of
    # collective traffic landing just before the top-k does.
    #
    # COST: +2.7% on chunked_topk at the GPT-OSS vocab (A/B in one session, TpbSgCyclesSum:
    # +2.9% at BxS=1, +1.7% at BxS=4, +3.5% at BxS=8). That is the price of the ordering.
    #
    # If someone wants that back, the tempting refinement is to keep dge_mode.none on the STORE
    # and take the compiler's mode only for the RELOAD. Do NOT land that on the strength of a
    # green 128-rank run: this defect showed on 2 of 128 row blocks, so a variant that merely
    # narrows the window passes that test by luck. dge_mode.unknown is worth its 2.7% because it
    # is a categorical ordering guarantee rather than a statistical one, and the failure it
    # prevents is a silently wrong token id.
