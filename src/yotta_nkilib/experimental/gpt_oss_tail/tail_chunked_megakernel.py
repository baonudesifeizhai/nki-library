"""GPT-OSS decode sampling tail: RMSNorm -> lm_head -> top-k -> sampler, ONE collective.

    final RMSNorm -> lm_head GEMM -> all_to_all(all ranks) -> chunked_topk -> sampler

WHY ONE COLLECTIVE
------------------
The vocab is column-parallel across ``VTP`` ranks, so no rank can take a global top-k
alone. The established answer is to top-k each rank's shard and reduce across ranks with a
second collective, which costs two collectives, a group-aware index correction, a packed
value/index collective, and a batch-row permutation the caller has to undo.

This kernel instead spends its ONE collective bringing the FULL vocab onto each rank -- an
all-to-all that trades vocab-parallelism for batch-parallelism -- and then takes the whole
top-k locally with ``chunked_topk``, which exists precisely because a 201,088-wide vocab
exceeds ``nisa.topk``'s per-call ceiling. Everything the two-collective form needs in
between simply has no counterpart here:

* **No index correction.** After the all-to-all over the replica group ``[0 .. VTP-1]`` in
  RANK ORDER, peer ``p``'s shard lands at columns ``[p*V_s, (p+1)*V_s)``, and peer index IS
  vocab-shard index. So a column index in the assembled row already IS the global vocab id,
  and ``chunked_topk`` returns global ids with no fix-up of any kind.
* **No packed collective.** Nothing has to travel with its index, so there is no
  ``[rows, 2k]``-vs-``[2*rows, k]`` packing orientation to get wrong and no fp32 inflation
  of bf16 values.
* **Row ownership is a closed form, not a lookup.** With a single hop it is the identity --
  rank ``r`` owns ``[r*R, (r+1)*R)``, ``R = gbs/VTP`` -- so the caller's final ``all_gather``
  over the same rank-ordered group concatenates straight into batch order. Multi-hop (which
  trn3 forces, see below) makes it a mixed-radix sum instead, still closed-form and provided
  by this module's ``owned_row_block``, but the caller must then de-permute. The
  batch-grouped exchange (``a2a_batch_groups > 1``) adds one more mixed-radix digit and
  makes ownership STRIDED -- ``owned_rows`` is the map in force in every case.

WHICH COLLECTIVE ACTUALLY RUNS (why ``hop_meshes`` exists)
---------------------------------------------------------
"One collective" is the DATAFLOW claim -- one vocab-parallel-to-batch-parallel exchange rather
than a top-k-then-reduce pair. It is not a claim that the exchange is one hardware mesh
operation, because on trn3 it cannot be. Measured on a reserved 16-device trn3 host (16
devices x 8 cores = the 128 LNC=1 ranks of production):

    a2a group                        | device layout        | result
    ---------------------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------
    8 contiguous   {0..7}            | 1 device, 8 cores    | PASS
    4 stride 8     {0,8,16,24}       | 4 devices, 1 core ea | PASS
    16 stride 8    {0,8,...,120}     | 16 devices, 1 core ea| PASS
    16 contiguous  {0..15}           | 2 devices, 8 cores ea| FAIL: op_type 7 unsupported
    128 all ranks                    | 16 devices, 8 cores  | FAIL: op_type 7 unsupported
    4 stride 4     {0,4,8,12}        | 2 devices, 2 cores ea| FAIL: encd_mesh_memcopy

The constraint is the group's DEVICE LAYOUT, not its size. A group must be entirely within one
device, or hold exactly one core per device; a MIXED group -- several devices with several cores
each -- has no mesh subtype that implements all-to-all and is rejected with
``__select_mesh_subtype: not a supported operation for mesh (op_type 7)``. Payload size is not
the trigger: the 16-contiguous rejection carries ``total_sz 0x800`` and the 128-rank one
``0x62300``.

Reading it as a size limit is the easy mistake, and it costs a hop: it makes 8 look like the
ceiling, which forces three hops, when in fact ``(8, 16)`` is legal and sufficient -- hop 0
device-local, hop 1 one core per device across all 16. That is exactly the decomposition the
existing sharded tail uses.

``all_gather`` at 128 also runs, but it is not the right tool here: it hands every rank EVERY
batch row, which at gbs=1024 is 412 MB per rank against 6.4 MB for the two-hop all-to-all, and
extracting just this rank's rows needs a rank-dependent slice one shared NEFF cannot express.

Note these limits differ by host. On the shared fleet's trn3_a0 a single mesh passes at 16 and
32 but aborts at >= 64 in ``encd_mesh_memcopy``, while MORE THAN ONE mesh per NEFF fails to
load at any rank count -- the exact opposite of what reserved trn3 allows. So a decomposition
must be validated on the host it will run on; ``collective_probe.py`` holds both matrices.

STATUS
------
Correct and passing every gate at VTP = 8, 16 and 32 (values, indices, tokens, logits, with
per-row-varying sampling params and degenerate/extreme inputs), single-hop and multi-hop.

CALLER CONTRACTS
----------------
Three, all of them load-bearing:

1. ``lm_head_weight_t`` is ``[H, V_s]`` **bf16**, i.e. ALREADY TRANSPOSED, and C-contiguous.
   bf16 is the GPT-OSS checkpoint's own lm_head precision, so passing fp32 would not be more
   accurate than the model -- it would just double the dominant HBM read. The kernel DMAs it
   straight to bf16 SBUF and matmuls in bf16 with an fp32 PSUM accumulator.
   ``nc_matmul`` contracts the partition dim, so the weight must present H on partitions.
   Reading an untransposed ``[V_s, H]`` shard forces ``V_s`` separate short runs per
   H-chunk instead of one contiguous run; a transposed VIEW (no copy) keeps the original
   strides and the DMA descriptor is built from strides, so it provides none of the benefit.
   Transposing is a one-time host cost on a tensor that never changes.
2. ``replica_groups`` is a single group listing ALL ``VTP`` ranks IN RANK ORDER. The
   no-index-correction property above is a direct consequence of that ordering; a permuted
   group silently returns wrong vocab ids.
3. ``sampling_params`` is ``[R, 3]`` -- THIS RANK'S rows only, not the whole batch. The
   caller slices by ``owned_rows`` (``[r*R, (r+1)*R)`` for a single ungrouped hop; strided
   with ``a2a_batch_groups > 1``; a mixed-radix block multi-hop). Passing the full ``[gbs, 3]``
   would make every rank apply rows ``0..R-1``'s temperature and top-p to its own rows, a
   wrong-token bug invisible to any test whose sampling params happen to be uniform.

THE mxfp4 VARIANCE CONVENTION (do not "simplify")
-------------------------------------------------
GPT-OSS pads hidden 2880 -> 3072, and under the mxfp4 checkpoint the hidden dim is SHUFFLED,
so the padding lanes are INTERLEAVED rather than a contiguous tail. Two consequences:
variance is ``sum(x^2)/H_u`` (equal to ``mean(x^2 over all H) * H/H_u`` only because the
padding is exactly zero), and zeroing the padding (applied to GAMMA at load time -- see
``_load_gamma_broadcast`` for why that is equivalent to re-zeroing the normed output) goes
through a ``[4, H/4]`` view killing columns ``>= H_u/4`` of each group. A contiguous
``[..., H_u:] = 0`` zeroes the WRONG lanes; that is the bf16 checkpoint's convention and it
changes the answer here.

LNC=1 BY DESIGN
---------------
``VTP = 128`` LNC=1 ranks is what makes ``V_s = 201088/128 = 1571``. ``n_prgs == 1`` is
asserted rather than assumed: the stages after the collective are not program-sharded and
carry no ``core_barrier``, so at LNC=2 both programs would race on the same ``shared_hbm``
collective buffers. Note that passing ``num_programs=1`` to an inner kernel does NOT pin
this -- gpsimd_topk re-reads the count from the live grid -- which is why the assert is here.

    """RMSNorm + lm_head GEMM for one 128-row tile, pipelined at block/chunk granularity.

    Returns ``(acc_ps, rms)``. With ``deferred_rms`` (the default), ``acc_ps`` is the
    ``[_PMAX, V_s]`` fp32 PSUM accumulator holding this tile's UNNORMALIZED logits
    ``(x * gamma) @ W`` and the CALLER multiplies the ``[_PMAX, 1]`` fp32 per-row ``rms`` in
    on its PSUM-read copies. DEFERRED RMS: since ``rms`` is a per-row scalar and the GEMM is
    linear, ``((x*rms)*gamma) @ W == rms * ((x*gamma) @ W)`` exactly -- and deferring it
    removes the one true data dependency that stalled the PE: every chunk used to wait on
    ``rms``, which needs ``sum(x^2)`` over the WHOLE row (~9 us of PE idle at the head of
    every tile; measured -3.8 us on the fenced head window). With ``deferred_rms=False`` the
    legacy in-chain form runs instead -- ``(x * rms) * gamma`` per chunk, ``acc_ps`` already
    normalized, the returned ``rms`` unused -- as a safety fallback with the exact
    pre-deferred numerics realization.

    THE POINT IS THE SCHEDULE'S SHAPE, NOT THE MATH. What the original rewrite fixed was three
    strictly serial phases -- a 12 us monolithic input DMA that every engine waited out, then
    ~15 us of full-width [rows, H] Vector/Scalar ops each gated on the previous, then 24
    transposes and 24 matmuls -- 54 us for a tile whose PE work is 16 us. This form breaks
    every one of those serialisations:

    * The input row loads in ``_NORM_DMA_BLOCK`` column blocks, and each block's
      ``sum(x^2)`` contribution runs on the Scalar Engine (``nisa.activation`` with
      ``op=nl.square`` accumulating into the engine's ``reduce_regs`` across blocks -- the
      idiom of ``mlp_tkg_rmsnorm``) while later blocks are still in flight. NOTE the
      ``reduce_regs`` chain is engine state: it tolerates interleaved ``reduce_cmd.idle``
      activations (every other activation in this kernel), but a hoisted reducing activation
      from other code WOULD corrupt it -- the WAW on ``sq_scratch`` is what pins the chain's
      own order.
    * ``rsqrt(ssq/H_u + eps)`` is ONE activation: the Scalar Engine applies
      ``op(data*scale + bias)`` natively, so the two full-width-free tensor_scalars the old
      form spent on ``/H_u`` and ``+eps`` cost nothing here.
    * Gamma applies in ONE ``scalar_tensor_tensor`` per 128-column GEMM chunk --
      ``(x + fence0) * gamma`` -- feeding that chunk's transpose+matmul immediately. RMS is
      NOT in this chain (see DEFERRED RMS above): the rsqrt runs concurrently on the Scalar
      Engine and lands on the caller's PSUM reads, so no matmul waits for the full row.

    The bf16 boundary moves by exactly one algebraic step and not in magnitude: the bf16
    rounding lands on ``x * gamma`` instead of ``x * rms * gamma``. bf16's relative error is
    scale-invariant (same exponent range as fp32), so the per-element error bound is
    IDENTICAL -- one bf16 rounding either way -- and the trailing fp32 multiply by rms adds
    2^-24, invisible at bf16 output granularity. Verified by simulation at the production
    shape against fp64 ground truth: both forms sit at the same distance from exact (mean
    1.66e-3 relative), greedy argmax flips ZERO rows, and the sampling distributions differ
    by <= 0.7% total variation. What DOES change is the last-ulp REALIZATION -- logits move
    within the bf16 noise floor relative to the previous build, so fixed-seed sampled tokens
    can land on an equally-valid neighbour at cdf crossings. Same class of wiggle as any
    resummation change, arbitrated the same way: tie-guarded gates, regenerated hashes.

    On the GEMM half nothing changed: ``nc_matmul`` contracts the PARTITION dim of both
    operands, so H must be on partitions for both. The activations get an on-chip per-chunk
    ``nc_transpose``; the WEIGHT is required to arrive already transposed as ``[H, V_s]`` --
    see CALLER CONTRACTS -- which makes the per-chunk read ``h_len`` ADJACENT rows of ``V_s``
    contiguous elements, i.e. ONE contiguous run rather than ``V_s`` short strided ones.
    BF16 THROUGHOUT, INCLUDING THE WEIGHT DMA: the GPT-OSS lm_head ships bf16, so fp32 here
    buys no accuracy over the checkpoint -- it just doubles the dominant HBM read (9.65 MB per
    rank per pass instead of 19.30 MB, re-read once per row tile).

    # BIAS (gating ssq -> rms) and each GEMM chunk's scalar_tensor_tensor ADD (gating every

    Selection is a masked sum: build ``ramp == position`` and reduce ``mask * data``. That is
    four vector ops on a ``[rows, k]`` tile, against one gather instruction -- but the gather
    is avoided deliberately. ``nc_n_gather`` returned ZERO here for a narrow ``data`` tile
    (k=8) even though the position and the data were both verified correct on device, and the
    same primitive is documented as corrupting results in its multi-group form above
    ``gather_group_size`` (see rotational_topk_utils). A masked sum has no such
    width-dependent behaviour, so this is correct for every k the kernel accepts.

    ``position`` is fp32 holding a small exact integer, and ``ramp`` holds exact integers, so
    the equality is exact rather than approximate. ``(ramp == position) * data`` is ONE fused
    ``scalar_tensor_tensor`` on the Vector Engine -- the compare's 1.0/0.0 feeds the multiply
    inside the instruction -- so the whole selection is two instructions, and every one of the
    sampler's instructions counts: at ``gbs = VTP`` the sampler owns a single batch row, every
    op runs on ONE partition in ~0.3 us of mostly dispatch, and this function sits twice on
    that serial chain.

    ``inf_safe``: the fused form NaN-poisons on ``+/-inf`` data -- ``0.0 * inf = NaN`` in
    every NON-selected slot, and the add-reduce then returns NaN instead of the selected
    value. The values this kernel samples may legally be ``+/-inf`` (GEMM overflow saturates,
    declared in-contract by ``skip_nan_fold``), so the top-k THRESHOLD selection must use the
    inf-safe form: ONE ``nisa.range_select`` (index-range mask + max-reduce, no multiply).
    It requires ``data`` to be DESCENDING along the free dim (the sorted top-k values are)
    and FLOORS ``position``: it returns the max over slots >= floor(position), which on a
    descending row is the slot floor(position) itself. The fused form needs an exact
    integer position, which its one caller (the sampled position, a count) always is.

    """GPT-OSS decode sampling tail with a single collective. See the module docstring.

    Args:
        hidden_states: ``[gbs, H]`` post-MoE hidden states in HBM; fp32, fp16, or bf16.
            A 16-bit input is widened to fp32 through an explicit on-chip conversion
            copy immediately after its (half-sized) load, which is EXACT (both half
            formats are subsets of fp32) -- so it produces bitwise the same outputs as
            passing a pre-widened fp32 copy, while halving this kernel's largest input
            DMA and letting a 16-bit producer skip an HBM widen round trip. The copy is
            load-bearing: engines fed 16-bit data directly compute at input precision.
        gamma: ``[1, H]`` final RMSNorm weight, fp32.
        lm_head_weight_t: ``[H, V_s]`` **bfloat16** lm_head shard for this rank, ALREADY
            TRANSPOSED and C-contiguous. ``V_s = V/VTP``. bf16 because that is the checkpoint's
            own precision -- see CALLER CONTRACTS.
        eps: RMSNorm epsilon (1e-5 for GPT-OSS).
        hidden_actual: ``H_u``, the unpadded hidden (2880). Defaults to H.
        zero_interleaved_pad: True for the mxfp4 checkpoint (interleaved padding lanes).
        k: candidates kept (256 in production).
        emit_logits: whether to return the fp32 ``[gbs, V_s]`` pre-collective logits. They are a
            DEBUG/GATING output -- nothing downstream of this kernel reads them; the collective
            carries the bf16 mirror instead. Keeping them costs a full extra HBM write of the
            shard (805 KB at the production shape, roughly half this kernel's hbm_write) plus its
            DMA and the fp32 SBUF tile. The tests set it True so the norm and the lm_head GEMM
            stay independently gated; a deployment that only wants tokens should set it False.
        sampling_params: ``[gbs/VTP, 3]`` or ``[gbs/VTP, 4]`` fp32. Columns are
            ``[top_k, top_p, temperature]``; the optional 4th column is the per-row
            inverse-transform draw ``u`` in ``[0, 1)`` -- the RUNTIME form of the compiled-in
            ``_DETERMINISTIC_DRAW`` (0.5), so sweeping the draw is a data change rather than a
            NEFF rebuild. Rows are THIS RANK'S only -- see ``owned_row_block`` for which rows
            those are when more than one hop is used. When None the sampler is skipped and no
            token is returned.
        replica_groups: one group listing all ``VTP`` ranks IN RANK ORDER. Shorthand for a
            single-hop ``hop_meshes=(replica_groups,)``; supply exactly one of the two.
        hop_meshes: one replica-group mesh per all-to-all hop, from
            ``collective_probe.compose_hops``. Hop sizes must multiply to ``VTP``. Needed
            because an all-to-all replica group must be device-local or one-core-per-device --
            see WHICH COLLECTIVE ACTUALLY RUNS in the module docstring.
        dummy_collectives: prepend a zero all-reduce fence per hop mesh so the fence, not the
            real hops, absorbs rank-arrival skew. A PROFILING instrument: it cannot change the
            answer but it adds a collective per mesh to every call, so it defaults off and
            profiling runs opt in. Without it a per-hop duration is mostly dispatch jitter.
        debug_taps: forward ``chunked_topk``'s seven diagnostic taps as extra outputs, APPENDED
            after everything else so the existing output positions do not move. A DIAGNOSTIC
            instrument for hardware-only index defects -- see DEBUG TAPS in ``chunked_topk``.
            It changes this kernel's arity, so leave it off unless the consumer expects them.
        deferred_rms: apply the per-row RMSNorm scale on the GEMM's PSUM-read copies instead
            of on the GEMM's input (exact algebra: ``rms`` is a per-row scalar and the GEMM
            is linear), which stops every matmul from waiting on the full row's sum of
            squares -- measured -3.8 us on the fenced gbs=128 head. Numerically the SAME
            one-bf16-rounding-per-element bound; only the last-ulp realization moves, so
            fixed-seed sampled tokens can shift at cdf crossings (same class as any
            resummation change). Default True; a SAFETY FALLBACK to the legacy in-chain
            form -- ``(x*rms)*gamma`` feeding the GEMM, the pre-deferred realization
            bit-for-bit -- is one trace-time flag away if a consumer needs it.
        skip_nan_fold: skip ``chunked_topk``'s stage-1 NaN fold. Sound here because the top-k
            input is this kernel's OWN GEMM output: finite hidden/gamma/weight inputs give
            finite bf16 products summed in fp32, and even an overflow saturates to +/-inf --
            which ``nisa.topk`` orders fine (the fold only exists for NaN, which would take
            inf arithmetic INSIDE the GEMM, i.e. already-garbage inputs). The fold costs a
            full-width compare + predicated copy per stage-1 tile on the post-collective
            serial chain. Default True; the fold is one trace-time flag away for a caller
            that wants the belt-and-suspenders behavior back. Outputs are BITWISE identical
            either way on any NaN-free input -- unlike ``deferred_rms`` this cannot move even
            an ulp, because it deletes ops whose effect on finite data is the identity.

        a2a_batch_groups: split the exchange into this many batch-group collectives, one
            per gbs/G whole lm_head tiles (single-hop only; G must divide rows_per_rank and
            the geometry must support the receive-layout fold -- asserted; groups aligned to
            whole 8-row sort tiles overlap best but are not required). Group g's
            exchange fires as soon as its own lm_head tiles' mirror stores land -- under
            the rest of the GEMM -- pulling the exchange forward by up to (G-1)/G of its
            wire time minus (G-1) launch serializations. OWNERSHIP CONTRACT CHANGES with
            G > 1: rank r owns the STRIDED row set given by ``owned_rows`` (one extra
            mixed-radix digit), not ``owned_row_block``'s contiguous block --
            ``sampling_params`` rows and every consumer of the per-rank outputs must use
            that map. Gate-validated, not bitwise: regrouping a collective changes the
            runtime's internal transfer realization.

    Returns:
        ``(logits, topk_values, topk_indices)`` and, when sampling, ``tokens``.
        ``logits`` is this rank's ``[gbs, V_s]`` fp32 shard. ``topk_values`` and
        ``topk_indices`` are this rank's ``[gbs/VTP, k]`` rows, with indices being GLOBAL
        vocab ids. ``tokens`` is ``[gbs/VTP, 1]``. Which batch rows this rank owns is
        ``owned_rows(rank, VTP, gbs, hops, a2a_batch_groups)``: the IDENTITY for a single
        ungrouped hop, so a rank-ordered ``all_gather`` concatenates straight into batch
        order, but a mixed-radix shuffle for multi-hop or a STRIDED set for the batch-grouped
        exchange, either of which the caller must undo.
