class NDSlice(nl.NKIObject):
    """A *view* over a tensor, decomposed into a grid of tiles.

    An ``NDSlice`` is the view object that every NeuroTile factory returns --
    ``tiles``, ``blocks``, ``alloc_tiles``, and ``alloc_blocks`` each
    produce one. It is the central value in a NeuroTile kernel: it is indexed to
    select tiles, iterated over, used to move data between HBM and SBUF, and reshaped
    to change its layout. Instances are obtained only from the factories; the class
    is not meant to be instantiated directly.

    A view holds no data of its own. Indexing or transforming a view produces a new
    view rather than modifying the original, and data moves only when ``load()`` or
    ``store()`` is called.

    The attributes below describe the shape and structure of a view. The operations
    it supports are grouped under :doc:`Data movement <data-movement>`,
    :doc:`Indexing & iteration <indexing-iteration>`, and
    :doc:`View transforms <view-transforms>`.

    .. warning::

       This API is experimental and may change in future releases.

    Attributes:
        shape (tuple[int, ...]): The number of tiles along each dimension that remain
            to be iterated, suitable for driving a loop (``for i in
            range(view.shape[0])``). For a freshly created tile view this is the full
            tile grid; indexing a dimension drops that dimension from ``shape``.
        element_shape (tuple[int, ...]): The number of individual elements (not tiles)
            along each dimension that the view covers. Selecting a whole tile leaves
            it unchanged -- ``view[i, j]`` still covers a full ``tile_size`` tile --
            whereas slicing to part of a tile (for example ``tile[:, 0:64]``) reduces
            it.
        tile_size (tuple[int, ...] | None): The shape of one tile -- the granularity
            each ISA instruction operates on after a ``load()``. ``None`` for an
            untiled view (e.g. the single-tile result of a transform).
        tile_shape (tuple[int, ...] | None): The number of tiles along each dimension
            of the whole view: ``element_shape`` divided by ``tile_size`` and rounded
            up. Unlike ``shape``, it always reflects the complete tile grid and does
            not change as the view is indexed. ``None`` for an untiled view.
        index_stride_elements (tuple[int, ...]): For each current public index dim,
            the number of source elements advanced by one logical index step. Use it
            to maintain runtime counters passed through ``nt.element_offset(...)``.
        block_size (tuple[int, ...] | None): The number of tiles per block along each
            dimension, for a view created by ``blocks`` / ``alloc_blocks``. ``None``
            when the view has no block grouping.
        block_shape (tuple[int, ...] | None): The number of blocks along each
            dimension. ``None`` when the view has no block grouping.
        is_tiled (bool): ``True`` if the view was created with a ``tile_size`` (every
            view except an untiled one).
        is_blocked (bool): ``True`` if the view groups its tiles into blocks.
        ndim (int): The number of dimensions of the view.
        is_remainder (bool): ``True`` if the region this view covers ends on a partial
            tile -- that is, the extent is not an exact multiple of ``tile_size``, so
            the last tile along some dimension is smaller than a full tile (the view's
            origin offset is taken into account, so an offset that pushes the trailing
            tile past the source also sets it) -- or if the view carries a runtime
            (gather / scatter or runtime-scalar) index, which is conservatively treated
            as a remainder. A broadcast (stride-0) dimension never raises the flag on
            its own.
        dtype: The element data type.
        buffer_type: The memory region the view lives in: ``nl.shared_hbm``,
            ``nl.private_hbm``, ``nl.sbuf``, or ``nl.psum``.
        data: The view's region as the underlying NKI tensor -- the single operand
            handle to pass to ``nisa.*`` compute ops, ``.store()``, and manual DMAs.
            Carries the view's offset / strides; same role for every buffer type.

        Select part of a view by indexing it, following NumPy's indexing conventions.

        operates on. No data is moved: indexing returns a new view, and the DMA happens
        later when ``load()`` or ``store()`` is called on the result.

        Indexing is the most-used NeuroTile operation and accepts a range of keys, from a
        plain integer to a runtime index tensor for gather and scatter. The sections
        below progress from the simplest case.

        .. warning::

           This API is experimental and may change in future releases.

        Args:
            key (int | slice | tuple | NDSlice | nl.NkiTensor): What to select along one or
                more dimensions. An ``int`` or ``slice`` selects at tile granularity (or
                block granularity for a block view); a tuple applies one key per leading
                dimension, left to right; a loaded index view (or raw SBUF ``nl.NkiTensor``)
                performs a runtime gather or scatter. See the sections below.

        Returns:
            NDSlice: A new view over the selected region -- a single tile, a row or column
            of tiles, a rectangular sub-grid, or a gathered set of rows. Calling
            ``load()`` / ``store()`` on it moves the data. Indexing a block of a block view
            (``blocks[bi, bj]``) returns the tile grid inside that block, addressed by
            interior tile coordinate (``block[ti, tj]``).

        Raises ``AssertionError`` in any of these cases:

        - more keys are given than the view has dimensions.
        - a compile-time integer index is out of range (valid range ``[-extent, extent)``
          on that dim).
        - a compile-time slice has step ``< 1``, is out of range (outside ``[0, extent]``),
          or is empty (``stop <= start``).
        - a slice is applied to a dimension whose current extent is unknown.
        - a bool key (``True`` / ``False``) is given -- it must be written as an explicit
          ``int``.
        - the key is an unsupported type -- a ``list``, ``dict``, ``str``, or ``float``
          (Boolean masks and lists of indices are rejected).

        Runtime keys (a runtime scalar / loop variable, or a loaded index view) and runtime
        slice bounds are not bounds-checked at trace time; NKI bounds-checks them at run
        time. An ellipsis (``...``) or ``None`` key is not supported and is not validated --
        it is silently mishandled rather than rejected, so it must not be passed.

        Basic indexing
        --------------
        A tile grid is indexed by tile coordinate. Each key selects along one dimension,
        in order, as in NumPy:

        .. code-block:: python

            tiles = nt.tiles(src, tile_size=(128, 512))   # a 2-D grid of tiles

            one  = tiles[i, j]      # the single tile at row i, column j
            row  = tiles[i]         # the whole i-th row of tiles (same as tiles[i, :])
            col  = tiles[:, j]      # the whole j-th column of tiles
            sub  = tiles[1:3, 0:2]  # a 2x2 rectangular sub-grid of tiles
            last = tiles[-1, -1]    # negative indices count from the end

        Each result is itself a view: ``tiles[i, j].load()`` brings one tile into SBUF,
        while ``tiles[i].load()`` brings a whole row in as one coalesced DMA. The ``##``
        cells below show what each key selects from a ``4 x 4`` grid:

        .. code-block:: text

            tiles[1, 2]        tiles[0]            tiles[:, 3]
            (one tile)         (a row)             (a column)

        Slicing for sharding
        --------------------
        A strided slice (``start:stop:step``) selects every ``step``-th tile. Combined
        with a per-core rank this is how a kernel shards work across cores -- the
        sharding helpers (``block_range``, ``interleaved_range``, ...) return exactly
        these slices:

        .. code-block:: python

            own = nt.interleaved_range(nl.program_id(0), nl.num_programs(0), tiles.shape[0])
            local = tiles[own, :]   # this core's tiles only

        Gather and scatter (runtime indices)
        ------------------------------------
        To select rows whose positions are known only at runtime, a **loaded index view**
        is passed as the key in place of an integer. Each entry of the index selects one
        source row, and the hardware fetches them all in a single indirect DMA -- a
        *gather* on ``load()`` and a *scatter* on ``store()``.

        The index is an SBUF tile of shape ``(K, 1)``: ``K`` row positions, one per
        partition. It is placed in the position of the dimension being gathered along:

        .. code-block:: python

            # Gather K rows of `data` named by `indices` (shape (K, 1)): out[i] = data[indices[i]]
            data_iter = nt.tiles(data, tile_size=(N, T_D))     # full N rows, T_D-wide columns
            idx_iter  = nt.tiles(indices, tile_size=(K, 1))

            idx = idx_iter[0, 0].load()                        # the index tile, in SBUF
            gathered = data_iter[idx, j].load()                # gather -> (K, T_D) in SBUF

            # Scatter is the mirror, on store():
            out_iter[idx, j].store(values.data)                # out[indices[i]] = values[i]

        The index names which source row lands in each output row:

        .. code-block:: text

            index (SBUF)      data (HBM)         gathered (SBUF)
            ┌─────────┐       ┌──────────┐       ┌──────────┐
            │ idx[0]=2│       │ row 0    │       │ row 2    │  <- data[2]
            │ idx[1]=0│  ──>  │ row 1    │  ──>  │ row 0    │  <- data[0]
            │ idx[2]=3│       │ row 2    │       │ row 3    │  <- data[3]
            └─────────┘       │ row 3    │       └──────────┘
                              │ ...      │
                              └──────────┘

        Selecting one dynamic row or column (scalar index)
        --------------------------------------------------
        A loaded index of shape ``(1, 1)`` holds a single runtime position and shifts the
        whole window by it. Its position in the key chooses which dimension it shifts:

        .. code-block:: python

            pos = idx_iter[0, 0].load()          # one runtime position, shape (1, 1)
            row = data_iter[pos, 0].load()       # dynamic row   -> (1, D)
            col = data_iter[0, pos].load()       # dynamic column -> (N, 1)

        A plain runtime scalar key is a logical coordinate at the current view level. On
        tile/block axes, NeuroTile may scale an SBUF scalar internally to produce the
        source-element ``scalar_offset``. If the runtime value is already an element offset
        (for example a counter incremented by ``view.index_stride_elements[dim]``), wrap it
        with ``nt.element_offset(offset)`` so NeuroTile passes it through without scaling:

        .. code-block:: python

            tile = data_iter[tile_idx, j].load()                 # logical tile coordinate
            tile = data_iter[nt.element_offset(row_offset), j].load()  # element offset

        Mixing fixed and dynamic indices
        --------------------------------
        Static indices (an ``int`` or loop variable) and one runtime index combine in a
        single key: the static parts select a fixed base, and the runtime part selects
        within it. A KV-cache read is the canonical example:

        .. code-block:: python

            kv = nt.tiles(kv_cache, tile_size=(1, D))    # kv_cache: [B, S, D]
            seq = seq_iter[0, 0].load()                  # runtime sequence position (1, 1)
            vec = kv[batch_id, seq].load()               # batch_id fixed, seq dynamic -> (1, D)

        Granularity: tile, block, and element level
        --------------------------------------------
        Indexing an HBM, tile, or block view operates at tile (or block) granularity. On an
        SBUF view, indexing entirely within one tile (every key at element granularity)
        slices the SBUF array directly and returns an element-level SBUF view -- this is how
        a loaded tile is sub-addressed. One special case: an integer index on the partition
        (P) dimension narrows it to a single row rather than removing the dimension, because
        SBUF data always keeps its partition dimension (the result stays 2-D).

        Indexing a batch dimension
        --------------------------
        When a view's only remaining iteration dimension is a batch dimension and the
        trailing tile grid is a single tile (``(1, ..., 1)`` -- for example
        ``nt.tiles(src, tile_size=(P, F))`` on a ``(B, P, F)`` source), indexing the batch
        dimension lands directly on that single tile at element level. The result is ready
        to ``load()`` as-is; do not subscript it further:

        .. code-block:: python

            src_tiles = nt.tiles(src, tile_size=(P, F))   # src.shape == (B, P, F)
            slab = src_tiles[b]                            # already a single tile
            tile = slab.load()                             # not slab[0, 0].load()

        Notes:
            A key is expected to carry **at most one** runtime (gather/scatter or scalar)
            index, with a gather index (``(K, 1)``) in the first position; these are usage
            preconditions for a correct result, not validated constraints, so a second
            runtime index or a misplaced gather is silently mishandled rather than
            rejected. The index tensor must reside in SBUF (a loaded view, or a raw
            ``nl.NkiTensor``) and the data tensor must reside in HBM.

        .. warning::

            A gather index addresses rows of the **underlying tensor's first dimension**,
            not of any reshaped logical view. To gather along a flattened axis (for
            example, a ``[B, S, D]`` cache flattened to ``[B*S, D]``), reshape the **raw**
            tensor with ``tensor.reshape(...)`` before calling ``nt.tiles``. A metadata
            view transform such as ``flatten_dims`` does not change which axis the index
            walks, so the gather would read the wrong rows.

        See Also:
            load / store: move the selected (or gathered) data between HBM and SBUF.
            slice: narrow a view to part of a single tile, at element granularity.

        deflected to the cursor's dim. This handles ``row[j]`` after
        ``row = v[i, :].load()`` -- the user's single key targets the
        surviving iteration dim, not the consumed PARTITION leaf.

        After all keys, the cursor advances past every consumed dim and
        any dim whose surviving outer is no longer iteration-level (e.g.
        a slice that landed exactly on a tile-leaf). If the cursor would
        run off the end and any other dim still has an iteration-level
        outer, it wraps to expose the next-level grid (e.g. a consumed
        block reveals its interior tile grid).

        cleanup() drops fully-consumed dims and auto-pops trivial tile
        levels after batch collapse; ``drop_dim`` adjusts the cursor for
        dropped dims so no remapping is needed here.

        """tolist(dim=None) -> list

        Return the view's tiles (or rows, columns, or blocks) as a plain Python list, for
        iteration with a ``for`` loop that does not track indices.

        This is the form to use when the loop body does the same thing to every tile and
        does not need the tile's position. A bare ``for x in view`` is not supported --
        the NKI tracer cannot iterate a view directly -- so ``tolist()`` provides the
        iterable.

        .. warning::

           This API is experimental and may change in future releases.

        Args:
            dim (int | None): Which dimension to iterate over. With the default ``None``,
                iteration follows the view's natural outer dimension: if leading batch dims
                remain, the leftmost is walked first and each sub-view drops that dimension;
                once batch dims are gone it walks the outer tile dimension. An integer
                iterates a specific dimension instead -- for example, ``dim=1`` walks columns
                rather than rows -- without dropping batch dims and without advancing the
                natural iteration position (each sub-view keeps every other dimension).

        Returns:
            list[NDSlice]: one view per position along the chosen dimension (the count
            equals the current item count along that dimension); each element is itself a
            view that can be indexed, loaded, or iterated further. With ``dim=None``, a
            0-dim view (everything indexed away) returns an empty list, and a view with no
            iteration dimension left returns a single-element list holding the view itself.

        Raises ``AssertionError`` if ``dim`` is neither ``None`` nor an integer (a bool is
        rejected), or is outside ``[0, ndim)``.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                for tile in tiles.tolist():            # walk every tile, no index needed
                    tile.store(process(tile.load()).data)

                for col in tiles.tolist(dim=1):        # iterate columns instead of rows
                    for tile in col.tolist():
                        ...

        Notes:
            ``len(view)`` is the product of every per-dimension item count (the total number
            of tiles / positions across all dims), **not** the number of sub-views
            ``tolist()`` yields along the single iteration dimension. Use
            ``len(view.tolist())`` for the iteration-step count.

        Create a rotating-buffer stream along ``dim`` that overlaps each step's DMA with
        the previous step's compute.

        A stream is the tool for *flowing* operands -- the K dimension of a matmul, or
        weight blocks fed through compute -- where double-buffering hides DMA latency. A
        *stationary* operand is instead loaded once with ``load()``. Streams apply to HBM
        views only; the rotating buffers themselves live in SBUF.

        .. warning::

           This API is experimental and may change in future releases.

        Args:
            dim (int | None): The dimension to iterate over. The default ``None`` uses the
                view's outermost dimension that is still available to iterate (dimension 0
                for a freshly created view; dimension 1 for a row obtained by
                ``parent[i, :]``). An integer streams a specific dimension instead.
            buffer_count (int): The number of rotating buffers: 2 for double-buffering, 3
                for triple-buffering. Defaults to 2.
            dtype: The dtype for the rotating buffers. Defaults to the source dtype. A
                ``stream.load(k, dtype=...)`` that does not match this allocates a fresh
                per-call buffer instead of using a rotating one, so that step does not
                overlap.
            transpose (bool): When ``True``, the stream is a transpose stream: each buffer
                is sized and typed for the transposed output, and every ``load()`` must
                repeat the same ``transpose`` / ``transpose_axes``.
            transpose_axes (tuple[int] | None): The gather-transpose permutation; requires
                ``transpose=True``. See ``NDSlice.load``.
            pattern_override (list[[int, int]] | None): A custom HBM access pattern applied
                per step (advanced). Requires ``out_shape``.
            out_shape (tuple[int, int] | None): The per-buffer SBUF shape. Required when
                ``pattern_override`` is set.

        Returns:
            BlockStream: The rotating-buffer pipeline, driven by ``stream.load(k)`` /
            ``stream[k]`` / ``stream.store(k)`` or by iterating it.

        Raises ``AssertionError`` in any of these cases:

        - called on an SBUF view.
        - the view still has leading batch dimensions that have not been indexed down to
          a single tile.
        - ``dim`` is not an int or is out of range.
        - ``dim`` is omitted and the view has no iteration dimension left (index a parent
          view or pass ``dim=`` explicitly).
        - ``buffer_count`` is not a positive int.
        - ``transpose_axes`` is set without ``transpose=True``.
        - ``pattern_override`` is set without ``out_shape``.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                stream = tiles[:, 0].stream(buffer_count=2)
                for k in nl.affine_range(K):
                    tile = stream.load(k)          # DMA into slot k%2, overlaps compute
                    nisa.nc_matmul(acc, lhs.data, tile.data)

        With ``buffer_count=2``, two SBUF slots are reused across steps so that the load
        of step ``k`` overlaps the compute of step ``k-1``::

                     slot 0      slot 1
                    ┌───────┐   ┌───────┐
            k=0     │ tile0 │   │       │   load 0
                    ├───────┤   ├───────┤
            k=1     │ tile0 │   │ tile1 │   compute 0 || load 1
                    ├───────┤   ├───────┤
            k=2     │ tile2 │   │ tile1 │   compute 1 || load 2   (slot 0 reused)
                    ├───────┤   ├───────┤
            k=3     │ tile2 │   │ tile3 │   compute 2 || load 3   (slot 1 reused)
                    └───────┘   └───────┘

        **SBUF cost.** Each buffer holds exactly one step along ``dim`` -- the same chunk
        that ``view[k]`` would yield -- so the total SBUF footprint is ``buffer_count``
        times that chunk::

            source view                       one buffer holds
            --------------------------------  --------------------------------
            tile column/row (tiles[:, m])     one tile
            multi-tile slice along the dim    that row/column of tiles, packed
            block column (blocks[:, b])       one block (block_size tiles)

        ``buffer_count=2`` is the default. A value of 3 helps only when the consumer is
        small enough that two stages cannot fully hide the DMA latency.

        **Load-type lock.** A stream's ``(transpose, transpose_axes)`` is fixed once --
        at construction (``stream(transpose=...)``) or by the first ``load()`` -- and it
        sizes every buffer, so all later loads must match. A given stream therefore
        serves one load type. Rotating gather-transpose streams are not supported; a
        non-streamed ``view[idx].load(transpose=True)`` is used instead.

            load: one-shot load for stationary operands.

                on the indirect (gather) path.
            oob_value (float | None): Pre-fill SBUF with this value before the DMA.
                Requires ``oob_mode``.
            priority (int | None): DMA QoS level in ``[0, 3]`` (lower = higher priority);
                omitted when None.
            dst (nl.NkiTensor | .data view | None): Pre-allocated SBUF destination. The
                library allocates one (at ``dtype``) when omitted. On a transpose its shape
                must equal the transposed output shape.
            pattern_override (list[[int, int]] | None): Custom HBM access pattern replacing
                the auto-generated one. Requires ``out_shape`` (or ``dst``). Not supported
                with ``transpose=True``.
            out_shape (tuple[int, int] | None): SBUF allocation shape ``(P, F)``. Required
                with ``pattern_override``. Not supported with ``transpose=True``.
            engine (nisa.engine.* | None): The HWDGE descriptor-generation engine for the
                transfer. ``None`` (default), ``nisa.engine.unknown``, and
                ``nisa.engine.dma`` let the compiler / DMA engine pick, regardless of
                ``dge_mode``. Only ``nisa.engine.sync`` or ``nisa.engine.scalar`` pin a
                specific engine, and only with ``dge_mode=nisa.dge_mode.hwdge``. Not
                supported on the transpose path.
            name (str | None): Instruction name for the emitted DMA; the profiler shows it
                as ``U-<name>``. Must be unique across every named instruction in the
                kernel, so vary it per iteration in a loop
                (``name="lhs_" + str(i)``) -- a repeat fails to compile with
                ``duplicate op name``. A partition-dim ``fold()`` load emits K DMAs and
                suffixes each with ``_k<k>``.

        Returns:
            NDSlice: A view over the freshly loaded (or caller-provided) SBUF buffer --
            see ``NDSlice`` for the view's attributes. ``.data`` is the underlying
            ``nl.NkiTensor``. A coalesced whole-row / whole-column selection (``tiles[i]`` or
            ``tiles[:, m]``) packs the selected tiles contiguously along the SBUF free axis
            in one DMA, and the result is indexed in SBUF with no further DMA.

        Raises ``AssertionError`` in any of these cases:

        - called on an untiled view (one with no ``tile_size``).
        - called on an SBUF view (``load()`` reads from HBM).
        - the view still has leading batch dimensions that have not been indexed down to
          a single tile.
        - ``oob_value`` is given without ``oob_mode``.
        - ``pattern_override`` is given without ``out_shape`` / ``dst``.
        - ``priority`` is outside ``[0, 3]``.
        - ``engine`` is set without ``dge_mode=hwdge`` or is not ``nisa.engine.sync`` /
          ``nisa.engine.scalar``.
        - a transpose rule is violated (``transpose_axes`` on a static transpose, an
          unsupported permutation, ``swdge`` / ``oob_mode.skip`` on a static transpose,
          or ``pattern_override`` / ``out_shape`` / ``engine`` with ``transpose=True``).
        - a transpose ``dst`` is given whose shape does not equal the transposed output
          shape (checked on both the static and gather paths).
        - a multi-P-tile load has a partition extent not divisible by the per-tile
          partition size (a multi-tile load with a P-remainder is unsupported).
        - the region cannot be expressed as one coalesced DMA.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                tile = tiles[i, j].load()                       # auto-allocate
                col  = tiles[:, m].load()                       # coalesced column load
                tile = tiles[i, j].load(dst=buf.data)           # into a caller buffer
                rem  = tiles[i, j].load(oob_mode=nisa.oob_mode.skip, oob_value=0.0)
                xT   = src_tiles[mi, ni].load(transpose=True)   # DMA-transpose

        **Single-DMA contract.** Every ``.load()`` emits one ``nisa.dma_copy``. If the
        region cannot be captured by a single coalesced access pattern, the call raises
        at trace time rather than silently issuing several -- loop and load tile-by-tile
        in that case. The sole exception is a partition-dim ``.fold()``, which emits K
        coalesced DMAs.

        **Transpose (transpose=True).** Requires a 2-byte dtype (bf16 / fp16). Two
        mechanisms, by whether the view carries an index:

        * Static (no index): transposes the view's tiles and **preserves the tile grid,
          axis-swapped** -- a ``(K, 1)`` source tile grid of ``(P, F)`` tiles returns a
          ``(1, K)`` grid of ``(F, P)`` tiles, indexable by coordinate (``xT[0, k]``), just
          like a non-transpose load. Single-DMA contract: F maps onto SBUF partition rows
          (<= 128), so ``F <= 128`` or an ``F`` that is a multiple of 128 is one coalesced
          DMA; an ``F`` that is ``> 128`` and *not* a multiple of 128 would need two DMAs
          and is **rejected** -- split with ``whole_tiles()`` / ``remainder_tiles()`` (or
          pick a tile_size whose F is <= 128 or a multiple of it).
        * Indirect / gather (``view[idx]``): gathers the indexed rows and transposes in
          one pass. ``transpose_axes`` picks the rank -- ``(1, 0)`` for 2-D,
          ``(2, 1, 0)`` for 3-D, ``(3, 1, 2, 0)`` for the 4-D reshape-trick form.

        ``pattern_override`` / ``out_shape`` are rejected on the transpose path -- it
        builds its own AP and output shape. A gather transpose returns a single tile:
        ``(D, N)`` for a 2-D ``(N, D)`` gather, ``(d2, d1, d0)`` for a 3-D ``(2, 1, 0)``,
        and ``(P, 1, f_tiles, rows)`` for the 4-D reshape-trick form.

        .. note::

            A gather (indirect) transpose carries compiler-enforced hardware constraints
            that NeuroTile does not re-validate: the index must be a uint32 2-D tensor, the
            gathered-row count must be a multiple of 16 in ``[16, 128]``, the transposed
            free dim must be ``<= 128``, and it requires TRN2 or later (``dge_mode=hwdge``
            on this path additionally requires ``P == 16`` and ``F % 128 == 0``). The
            ``oob_mode.skip`` / ``oob_value`` per-row skip on the gather-transpose path is
            plumbed through but unverified on hardware; do not rely on it without
            re-checking.

        **Out-of-bounds handling.** ``oob_mode=nisa.oob_mode.skip`` suppresses boundary
        DMA faults; skipped lanes keep their prior SBUF contents. Add ``oob_value`` to
        pre-fill the destination (one targeted ``memset`` before the DMA) so remainder
        lanes read a known value.

        Indirect indexing with blocks
        ------------------------------
        When the view carries a runtime index and a block grouping, the DMA count depends
        on the index kind: a scalar offset shifts the whole block base uniformly in a
        single coalesced DMA, while a vector (gather) offset issues one indirect DMA per
        tile within the block.

        Memory layout
        -------------
        SBUF has only 128 partition rows, so a load whose partition extent spans more than
        one P-tile does not stack tiles on the partition axis -- the extra P-tiles are
        packed into the free axis, and the returned buffer is ``(tile_P, total_F)`` with the
        P-tiles laid out flat along F. With ``out_shape`` set (and ``pattern_override``),
        the loaded buffer is typed at ``out_shape`` as a single tile, independent of the HBM
        source ``tile_size``.

            store: the SBUF-to-HBM mirror.

           This API is experimental and may change in future releases.

        Args:
            data (nl.NkiTensor | .data view): The SBUF source -- either a raw ``nl.NkiTensor``
                or the ``.data`` view of a loaded view. Pass ``view.data``, not the view
                object itself.
            dtype: Currently ignored -- ``store()`` performs no cast (the destination dtype
                is the HBM tensor's own). Any cast must be applied to ``data`` before the
                store. (Accepted for signature symmetry with ``load()``.)
            dge_mode (nisa.dge_mode.* | None): A DMA-generation mode hint.
            oob_mode (nisa.oob_mode.skip | None): When ``skip``, suppresses out-of-bounds
                DMA faults at boundaries; the skipped positions are simply not written.
            priority (int | None): The DMA QoS level in ``[0, 3]``; omitted when None.
            pattern_override (list[[int, int]] | None): A custom HBM access pattern, each
                level a ``[stride, count]`` pair.
            engine (nisa.engine.* | None): The HWDGE descriptor-generation engine for the
                transfer -- ``nisa.engine.sync`` or ``nisa.engine.scalar``. It applies only
                with ``dge_mode=nisa.dge_mode.hwdge``; with the default None the compiler
                selects the engine.
            name (str | None): Instruction name for the emitted DMA, Must be unique across
                every named instruction in the kernel.

        Returns:
            None.

        Raises ``AssertionError`` in any of these cases:

        - called on an untiled view (one with no ``tile_size``).
        - called on an SBUF view (``store()`` writes to HBM).
        - ``data`` is an ``NDSlice`` rather than its ``.data`` view.
        - the view still has leading batch dimensions that have not been indexed down to
          a single tile.
        - ``priority`` is outside ``[0, 3]``.
        - ``engine`` is set without ``dge_mode=hwdge`` or is not ``nisa.engine.sync`` /
          ``nisa.engine.scalar``.
        - ``pattern_override`` levels are not ``[stride, count]`` pairs.

        Every transform (``reshape``, ``reshape_dim``, ``permute``, ``flatten_dims``,
        ``squeeze_dim``, ``expand_dim``, ``broadcast``, ``slice``, ``split``) works
        uniformly on an HBM view (before ``load()``) and an SBUF view (after ``load()``),
        subject only to the SBUF partition-axis restrictions (``permute`` requires
        ``dims[0] == 0``; an element-level ``slice`` on dim 0 is routed through SBUF
        sub-indexing). The two differ in what comes back: a transformed **HBM** view is a
        single tile spanning the new shape (``tile_size`` equals the new ``element_shape``),
        so it is materialized with ``.load()`` first; a transformed **SBUF** view
        reinterprets the existing buffer in place (no copy) and comes back at element
        granularity, so it is indexed at element level and fed straight to a compute op
        without a load.

        Merge ``src_dim`` into ``into_dim``, reducing ``ndim`` by 1, via a DMA recipe.

        Unlike ``flatten_dims`` (adjacent dims, pure metadata), ``fold`` records a recipe
        that the next ``.load()`` / ``.store()`` applies, so it can merge *non-adjacent*
        dims at DMA time. It is symmetric for load and store (round-trip safe), and folds
        compose.

            NDSlice: a new view with ``ndim - 1`` dims and a fold recipe attached as an
            immutable DMA override; the recipe rides along until the next ``.load()`` /
            ``.store()`` consumes it. The merged dimension's size is the product of the two
            dims' sizes; its stride is taken from ``into_dim`` for ``position="outer"`` and
            from ``src_dim`` for ``position="inner"`` (to preserve the HBM access pattern --
            the SBUF side is built contiguously regardless). A free-dim fold pre-binds both
            the merged-axis access pattern and the post-fold SBUF destination shape onto the
            view, so the following ``.load()`` / ``.store()`` is fully self-describing and
            needs no ``out_shape=`` / ``pattern_override=``. Folds compose: folding a view
            that already carries a free-dim recipe threads the existing access-pattern base
            through the chain rather than rebuilding it.

        Raises ``AssertionError`` in any of these cases:

        - ``src_dim`` or ``into_dim`` is not an int in ``[0, ndim)``.
        - they are equal.

class BlockStream(nl.NKIObject):
    """A rotating-buffer DMA pipeline along one dimension of an HBM view.

    A ``BlockStream`` is the rotating-buffer DMA pipeline that ``NDSlice.stream()``
    returns; it is not constructed directly. The source is an HBM view and the rotating
    buffers live in SBUF. It allocates ``buffer_count`` SBUF buffers lazily on first
    access (the first load, iteration, indexing, or store -- constructing the stream
    allocates nothing), each sized for one step along the streamed dimension, and
    overlaps each step's DMA with the previous step's compute -- the standard
    double-buffering pattern for flowing operands. Each buffer holds exactly one step's
    worth of data: the same chunk a single-index subscript on that dimension yields
    (one tile for a tile column/row, one packed row/column of tiles for a multi-tile
    slice, one block for a block column). Buffers are sized from the view's *owned*
    extents, so under interleaved (gapped) sharding a slot holds only the owned tiles --
    dense SBUF, not the gapped iteration span. Stream position ``index`` maps to
    rotating slot ``index % buffer_count``, so slots are reused cyclically.

    The same rotating pool is driven in either of two ways:

    * By iteration -- ``for sv in stream: sv.load()`` (or ``stream.tolist()``). Each
      step's view comes with its rotating buffer already bound, so ``sv.load()``
      transfers into the correct buffer automatically.
    * By random access -- ``stream.load(k)`` / ``stream[k]`` / ``stream.store(k)``,
      for hand-written prolog / steady-state / epilog pipelining.

    The load type (``transpose`` / ``transpose_axes``) is fixed once -- at
    construction or by the first ``load()`` -- and sizes every buffer, so all later
    loads must match and a given stream serves one load type. Declaring
    ``transpose=True`` at construction sizes and grid-types every slot to the
    transposed output before any load runs, so ``stream[k]`` is a transposed-block view
    usable as a typed per-tile ``dst=`` target. The rotating-buffer dtype defaults to
    the source view's dtype. The step count and per-step stride are captured once, from
    the streamed dimension at construction time, and are not re-read; later indexing of
    the source view does not change them. Constructing a stream requires the source
    view's batch dims to be indexed away (see ``NDSlice.stream``).

       This API is experimental and may change in future releases.

        This is the steady-state call inside a streamed loop: with ``buffer_count=2``, step
        ``k`` overlaps the DMA into slot ``(k+1) % 2`` with the compute on slot ``k % 2``.

        There is no ``dst=`` parameter -- the destination is always the rotating slot (or a
        fresh buffer on a dtype mismatch). To load into a caller buffer, use
        ``NDSlice.load`` directly.

        .. warning::

           This API is experimental and may change in future releases.

        Args:

                ``index % buffer_count``.
            dtype: Cast on DMA. Defaults to the stream dtype; a different dtype bypasses the
                rotating slot (a fresh SBUF buffer is allocated for this call, so that step
                does not overlap). The same dtype-match guard applies on the iteration path:
                ``sv.load(dtype=...)`` differing from the bound buffer's dtype also bypasses
                the slot.
            transpose (bool): DMA-transpose this step into its slot. The first ``.load()``
                fixes the stream's load type and sizes the slots; later loads must repeat
                the same ``transpose`` / ``transpose_axes``.
            transpose_axes (tuple[int] | None): Per-rank gather-transpose permutation
                (indirect only); see ``NDSlice.load``. Must match across all loads.

                ``NDSlice.load`` on the non-transpose path -- so ``priority`` must be an int

                ``nisa.engine.scalar``) requires ``dge_mode=nisa.dge_mode.hwdge`` (``None`` /
                ``unknown`` / ``dma`` let the compiler pick). A transpose load takes no
                ``engine``. The stream's own ``pattern_override`` / ``out_shape`` apply on
                the non-transpose path only (the transpose slot is pre-sized).
            name (str | None): Instruction name for this step's DMA, suffixed with
                ``_<index>`` so a constant name stays unique across steps -- ``name="lhs"``
                at step 3 emits ``lhs_3``.

        Returns:
            NDSlice: the rotating slot's view (or a fresh SBUF buffer on a dtype mismatch).
            ``.data`` is the underlying ``nl.NkiTensor``. A step advances one position along
            the streamed dimension (like a single integer index on that dimension), so the
            loaded view exposes whatever one step contains -- for example the tile grid
            inside one block when streaming a block dimension -- for further indexing.

        Raises ``AssertionError`` if the load type disagrees with the stream's fixed
        ``transpose`` / ``transpose_axes``, plus every forwarded ``NDSlice.load`` check
        (``priority`` outside ``[0, 3]``; a pinned ``engine`` without ``dge_mode=hwdge`` or
        not ``sync`` / ``scalar``; ``oob_value`` without ``oob_mode``; ``engine`` on a

            Indexing, iteration, and ``store`` are mode-agnostic: on a stream whose load
            type is not yet fixed, any of them locks it to **non-transpose** before
            allocating the slots, and a later ``load(transpose=True)`` then raises
            (the slots are already sized for a non-transpose load). To transpose-stream,
            declare ``transpose=True`` at construction or issue a transpose ``load()``

        .. note::

            The slot is uniformly sized for a whole step, so on a partial step it
