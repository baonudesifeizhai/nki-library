    """tiles(source, tile_size=None, access_pattern=None, remainder=None) -> NDSlice

    Decompose a tensor into a logical grid of fixed-size tiles. No data is moved -- the
    grid is a logical *view*, indexed by tile coordinate (``view[i, j]``) rather than by
    hand-computed offsets and strides, and sharded across cores by slicing it. The
    buffer space (HBM or SBUF) is detected from the source, so an HBM tensor and a raw
    SBUF ``nl.ndarray`` are tiled the same way; a PSUM source is rejected (operate on a
    ``nt.psum_pool()`` bank's ``.data`` directly instead).

    This is the starting point for most kernels. ``tile_size`` defines the *compute
    grain* -- the shape each ISA instruction
    (``nisa.nc_matmul``, ``nisa.tensor_*``) operates on once a tile is loaded. When
    several tiles should move in a single DMA while retaining that compute grain,
    they are grouped with ``nt.blocks()``, which establishes a separate, coarser
    *DMA grain*.

    For example, ``tile_size=(128, 256)`` over a ``(512, 1024)`` tensor produces a
    ``4 x 4`` grid (``shape == (4, 4)``); each tile spans ``128`` elements on the P
    (partition) axis and ``256`` on the F (free) axis. ``tiles[i, j]`` selects one
    cell, ``tiles[i]`` a whole row, and ``tiles[:, j]`` a whole column::

                  256       256       256       256      <- F (free): 256 per tile

        P (partition): 128 per tile

    .. warning::

       This API is experimental and may change in future releases.

    Args:
        source (HBM tensor | nl.ndarray | NDSlice): The tensor to tile. A top-level
            HBM tensor; a sliced or transformed tensor (tiled directly using its own
            self-describing layout); a raw SBUF ``nl.ndarray`` (the SBUF space is
            detected from the source); or an existing ``NDSlice`` (re-tiled with
            ``tile_size=``, otherwise its block grouping is dropped). Required.
        tile_size (tuple[int, ...]): The per-tile shape, at least 2-D
            ``(P, F[, ...])``, every entry a positive int. Defines the *compute grain*.
            Required for a raw source; optional for an ``NDSlice``. Fewer dims than
            ``source`` makes the leading dims batch dims (see *Batch dimensions*). A
            ``tile_size`` larger than the source extent on a dim is accepted and yields
            a single partial tile there.
        access_pattern (list[[int, int]] | None): The source layout as
            ``[[stride, count], ...]``, one level per view dim, every entry a positive
            int. Its counts become the view's ``element_shape`` and its strides become
            the layout strides, overriding the source's own shape and physical strides.
            Raw HBM sources only -- a raw SBUF source rejects it (reshape / permute the
            view after construction instead). Defaults to the source's contiguous
            layout.
        remainder (str | None): ``"skip"`` floor-divides the grid (drops partial
            trailing tiles); None (default) keeps them, surfaced via
            ``view.is_remainder``. See *Remainder handling*.

    Returns:
        NDSlice: A tile-grid view over ``source`` -- see ``NDSlice`` for the view's
        attributes and operations. Indexing it selects tiles (``view[i, j]``); slicing
        it shards across cores (``nt.tiles(...)[nt.block_range(rank, n, total), :]``).

    Raises ``AssertionError`` in any of these cases:

    - ``source`` is None or is not a tensor-like object with a ``.shape`` (nor an
      ``NDSlice``).
    - ``source`` already carries a runtime (gather / dynamic-select) offset
      (apply the runtime index on the view instead: ``nt.tiles(t, ...)[k]``).
    - ``tile_size`` is missing on a raw source, is not a tuple/list of positive
      ints, has fewer than 2 dims, or its rank exceeds the view rank (the
      ``access_pattern`` level count if given, else the source rank).
    - ``access_pattern`` is malformed (not a list of positive ``[stride, count]``
      pairs) or its largest addressed offset reaches past the source's end.
    - a higher-rank ``access_pattern`` is paired with a ``tile_size`` that does not
      cover the whole view in one tile (only single-tile coverage is supported
      today).
    - the ``source`` resides in PSUM (a PSUM source is rejected -- operate on a
      ``nt.psum_pool()`` bank's ``.data`` directly).
    - ``access_pattern`` is given for an SBUF source (an SBUF source rejects
      ``access_pattern`` -- reshape / permute the view after construction instead).
    - an ``NDSlice`` source is combined with ``access_pattern`` or ``remainder``
      (both raw-source-only).

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            # Plain tile grid on a top-level HBM tensor: (512, 1024) -> 4x4 grid.
            src_tiles = nt.tiles(src, tile_size=(128, 256))
            for i in range(src_tiles.shape[0]):
                for j in range(src_tiles.shape[1]):
                    tile = src_tiles[i, j].load()

            # Shard across cores by slicing the view.
            own = nt.block_range(nl.program_id(0), nl.num_programs(0), src_tiles.shape[0])
            local = nt.tiles(src, tile_size=(128, 256))[own, :]

            # Strided source layout (every other row).
            view = nt.tiles(src, access_pattern=[[2 * N, M // 2], [1, N]], tile_size=(64, N))

    Source kinds
    ------------
    The operation depends on what ``source`` is and which other arguments are set::

        source             other args             result
        -----------------  ---------------------  --------------------------------
        raw HBM tensor     tile_size= (required)  tile-grid view over HBM
        raw HBM tensor     + access_pattern=      strides taken from the AP
        raw HBM tensor     + remainder="skip"     grid floor-divided (no partials)
        raw SBUF ndarray   tile_size= (required)  tile-grid view over SBUF
        sliced view        tile_size= (required)  strides/offset from the slice itself
        NDSlice            (no tile_size=)        drop the block grouping, keep tiles
        NDSlice            tile_size=             re-tile: rebuild grid at new size

    **Re-tile versus drop-block.** Both ``NDSlice`` forms return a view with
    ``block_size is None``; passing ``tile_size=`` rebuilds the tile grid at the new
    size, while omitting it keeps the existing tile structure. Outer shard / broadcast
    axes are preserved across both, and HBM and SBUF behave symmetrically.

    **SBUF sources.** An SBUF source is recognized from the source itself -- the
    canonical form is an ``NDSlice`` already carrying an SBUF layout (it supplies the
    buffer, offset, and dtype), and a raw SBUF ``nl.ndarray`` is accepted with offset 0.
    A raw *sliced* SBUF view is tiled directly from its own layout, the same as an HBM
    slice.

    Batch dimensions
    ----------------
    A ``tile_size`` with fewer dims than ``source`` is left-padded with 1s, turning the
    leading source dims into batch dims (each iterated over one slab at a time). The
    view's ``shape`` then leads with the batch extents -- a 3-D source with a 2-D
    ``tile_size`` gives ``shape == (B, M // tile_size[0], N // tile_size[1])``, where
    the first index selects a batch slab and the rest address the tile grid. Batch dims
    are indexed away (``view[b, i, j]``) or iterated over before ``.load()`` /
    ``.store()`` / ``.stream()``, which assert all batch dims are gone. ``tile_size``
    must be at least 2-D: write ``(N, 1)`` for a P-column tile or ``(1, N)`` for an
    F-row tile, never ``(N,)``.

    Access patterns
    ---------------
    The ``access_pattern`` level count is the *view's* rank, independent of the source
    rank: a 3-level AP on a 2-D source yields a 3-D view, and a 1-level AP flattens an
    N-D source. The source need only hold the AP's largest addressed offset. A
    higher-rank AP (more levels than the source rank) is supported only for single-tile
    coverage today -- the padded ``tile_size`` must equal the view shape exactly;
    multi-tile iteration over such a view is not yet supported.

    Remainder handling
    ------------------
    ``remainder="skip"`` truncates each tiled dim's extent down to an exact multiple of
    the padded ``tile_size`` before the grid is built (a per-dim floor-divide); batch
    dims and dims with no tile entry keep their full extent. The default (None) keeps
    the partial trailing tiles, each surfaced through ``view.is_remainder`` for the
    boundary DMA policy (see ``load`` / ``whole_tiles`` / ``remainder_tiles``).

    Memory layout
    -------------
    ``tile_size`` maps position-by-position onto the source's trailing dims: dim 0 is
    the SBUF partition (P) axis, and the rest are free (F) subdivisions kept as logical
    structure (not flattened), so a 3-D tile stays 3-D after ``.load()``. The physical
    SBUF backing is always 2-D ``(P, F_flat)`` -- a ``(P, F1, F2)`` tile is stored as
    ``(P, F1 * F2)`` and ``tile.data.shape`` reports the 2-D shape -- while the logical
    shape after ``.load()`` equals the tile's ``element_shape`` at load time::

        tile_size      source         batch dims   SBUF after .load()
        -------------  -------------  -----------  ------------------
        (P, F)         (M, N)         0            (P, F)
        (P, F)         (B, M, N)      1 (= B)      (P, F)
        (P, F1, F2)    (M, N1, N2)    0            (P, F1, F2)
        (P, 1)         (M, N)         0            (P, 1)
        (1, F)         (M, N)         0            (1, F)

    Sub-tile slicing (for example ``view[i, j][:, 0:64]``) narrows the tile's
    ``element_shape`` while preserving ``tile_size``; the P axis stays on dim 0 and can
    be narrowed but not rotated onto another dim. To map a different source dim onto P,
    reshape or permute the source first, or use ``load(transpose=True)``.

    See Also:
        blocks: coarser DMA grain (coalesced multi-tile DMA) over the same tiles.
        alloc_tiles: allocate a fresh tiled SBUF / HBM buffer.

    """blocks(source, block_size, tile_size=None, access_pattern=None) -> NDSlice

    Group a tensor's tiles into fixed-size rectangular blocks. No data is moved -- the
    block grid is a logical *view*, indexed by block coordinate (``blocks[bi, bj]``),
    that separates the *DMA grain* from the *compute grain*. The buffer space (HBM or
    SBUF) is detected from the source, so a raw SBUF ``nl.ndarray`` and an HBM tensor
    are block-tiled the same way; a PSUM source is rejected (operate on a
    ``nt.psum_pool()`` bank's ``.data`` directly instead).

    The block is the unit that moves between HBM and SBUF, while the underlying
    ``tile_size`` remains the unit each ISA instruction operates on. Three properties
    follow:

    * **Coalesced DMA.** A whole block transfers in a single ``nisa.dma_copy``
      rather than one DMA per tile, which reduces descriptor count and DMA-queue
      pressure and replaces many small strided transfers with one larger, more
      contiguous transfer.
    * **Compute grain preserved.** After a block is loaded, its individual
      ``tile_size`` tiles are still addressed and computed on independently
      (``block[ti, tj]``); the coarser DMA does not force a coarser matmul or
      tensor-op shape.
    * **Reuse and pipelining.** A resident block feeds many compute steps from SBUF,
      and ``blocks[:, b].stream()`` double-buffers one block per step.

    ``blocks.shape`` reports the block grid; indexing a block (``blocks[bi, bj]``)
    yields the tile grid inside that block. For example,
    ``block_size=(2, 2)`` over a ``4 x 4`` tile grid gives a ``2 x 2`` block grid; each
    block (heavy ``┏━┓`` box) is the DMA grain, while the tiles inside (light ``┌─┐``
    cells) remain the compute grain::

           block (0,0)         block (0,1)

    .. warning::

       This API is experimental and may change in future releases.

    Args:
        source (HBM tensor | nl.ndarray | NDSlice): The tensor to block-tile. The
            accepted source kinds are the same as for ``tiles()`` -- a top-level or
            sliced HBM tensor, a raw SBUF ``nl.ndarray``, or an existing ``NDSlice``.
            Required.
        block_size (tuple[int, ...]): The number of tiles per block along each
            dimension, at least 2-D, every entry a positive int. Required. A per-dim
            entry of 1 still groups that dimension (one tile per block there). Its rank
            must not exceed the source rank -- for an ``NDSlice`` source this is the
            view's current ``ndim``, for a raw source it is ``len(source.shape)``.
        tile_size (tuple[int, ...] | None): The per-tile (compute-grain) shape (at
            least 2-D). Required for a raw tensor source; for an ``NDSlice`` source it
            is inherited unless given, in which case the view is re-tiled before it is
            grouped into blocks.
        access_pattern (list[[int, int]] | None): The source layout as
            ``[[stride, count], ...]``. Raw HBM sources only -- a raw SBUF source
            rejects it (reshape / permute the view after construction instead).

    There is no ``buffer_type=`` parameter (the space is detected from the source) and
    no ``remainder=`` parameter: unlike ``tiles()``, partial-tile policy
    cannot be chosen at ``blocks()`` construction time, and boundary tiles are always
    kept (surfaced via ``view.is_remainder``). To drop partial tiles, build the tile
    view with ``nt.tiles(..., remainder="skip")`` first and group it into blocks.

    Returns:
        NDSlice: A block-grid view over ``source`` -- see ``NDSlice`` for the view's
        attributes and operations. Indexing a block (``blocks[bi, bj]``) yields the
        tile grid inside it (``block[ti, tj]``); slicing the block grid shards work
        at block granularity across cores.

    Raises ``AssertionError`` in any of these cases:

    - ``block_size`` is missing, is not a tuple/list of positive ints, has fewer
      than 2 dims, or its rank exceeds the source rank.
    - ``source`` already carries a runtime (gather / dynamic-select) offset
      (apply the runtime index on the view instead: ``nt.tiles(t, ...)[k]``).
    - ``tile_size`` is missing on a raw source.
    - an ``NDSlice`` source is combined with ``access_pattern`` (raw-source-only).
    - ``access_pattern`` is given for an SBUF source (an SBUF source rejects
      ``access_pattern``).
    - ``source`` resides in PSUM (PSUM accumulators come from ``nt.psum_pool()``;
      operate on a bank's ``.data`` directly).
    - any ``tiles()`` rule on ``tile_size`` / ``access_pattern`` is violated.

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            # 128x512 tiles grouped into 2x2-tile blocks; coalesced load, per-tile
            # compute, coalesced store -- the canonical block loop.
            src_blocks = nt.blocks(src, tile_size=(128, 512), block_size=(2, 2))
            dst_blocks = nt.blocks(dst, tile_size=(128, 512), block_size=(2, 2))
            for bi in range(src_blocks.shape[0]):
                for bj in range(src_blocks.shape[1]):
                    block = src_blocks[bi, bj].load()      # one DMA -> 2x2 tiles in SBUF
                    for ti in range(block.shape[0]):       # iterate the interior tile grid
                        for tj in range(block.shape[1]):
                            tile = block[ti, tj]           # one tile_size tile -- no DMA
                            nisa.tensor_scalar(tile.data, tile.data, nl.multiply, 2.0)
                    dst_blocks[bi, bj].store(block.data)    # one DMA writes the block back

            # Promote an existing (already sharded) tile view to block granularity.
            tv = nt.tiles(src, tile_size=(128, 512))[own, :]
            blks = nt.blocks(tv, block_size=(2, 2))

    Source kinds
    ------------
    The operation depends on what ``source`` is::

        source             other args                  result
        -----------------  --------------------------  ---------------------------
        raw HBM tensor     tile_size=, block_size=     block view over HBM
        raw SBUF ndarray   tile_size=, block_size=     block view over SBUF
        NDSlice            block_size= only            group its tiles into blocks
        NDSlice            block_size= + tile_size=    re-tile, then group into blocks

    ``block_size`` is mandatory; for a tile view with no block grouping, use
    ``nt.tiles()``. Every ``tiles()`` argument rule applies here as well.

    How blocks are formed
    ---------------------
    For a raw source, the tile grid is formed first (exactly as ``tiles()`` would, with
    the same ``tile_size`` / ``access_pattern``) and its tiles are then
    grouped into blocks of ``block_size`` tiles. For an ``NDSlice``
    source, ``block_size`` alone groups the existing tile grid, and ``block_size`` with
    ``tile_size`` re-tiles first and then groups; shard / broadcast structure is
    preserved either way. The block-grid extent on a dimension is
    ``ceil(tile_grid[dim] / block_size[dim])``.

    Raises ``AssertionError`` in any of these cases:

    - ``buffer_type`` or ``dtype`` is missing.
    - ``buffer_type`` is ``nl.psum`` or not an ``nl.MemoryRegion``.
    - both ``grid`` and ``element_shape`` are given.
    - ``tile_size`` is not a >= 2-D positive-int tuple.
    - ``grid`` / ``element_shape`` rank or entries disagree with ``tile_size``, or any
      entry is non-positive or a bool (a ``True`` / ``False`` entry is rejected even
      though Python treats bool as an int).

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            # Tile-aligned SBUF accumulator, then zero it.
            acc = nt.alloc_tiles(tile_size=(128, 512), grid=(4, 2), buffer_type=nl.sbuf, dtype=nl.float32)

                                 buffer_type=nl.shared_hbm, dtype=nl.bfloat16)

    Sizing: grid versus element_shape
    ---------------------------------
    ``grid`` allocates exactly ``grid * tile_size`` elements, which is tile-aligned.
    ``element_shape`` allocates the exact extent and ceiling-divides it into the tile
    grid, so the last tile along a dimension is a partial tile when the extent is not
    divisible -- and the returned view then reports ``is_remainder == True`` on that
    dim, so a caller detects the partial last tile without re-deriving the division (a
    tile-aligned ``grid`` allocation reports ``is_remainder == False``).
    ``element_shape`` is preferred unless the extent is known tile-aligned. With both
    omitted, the result is a single-tile allocation.

    Memory layout
    -------------
    An SBUF allocation is physically a flat 2-D ``nl.ndarray`` of shape
    ``(tile_size[0], total_tiles * tile_F)``, where ``tile_F`` is the product of
    ``tile_size[1:]`` and ``total_tiles`` counts the whole grid: every P-tile folds into
    the free (F) columns, so the physical partition extent never exceeds one tile's P
    dimension and a larger ``element_shape[0]`` widens F, never the partition axis. An
    HBM allocation is laid out row-major contiguous over the ``element_shape`` (which
    defaults to ``grid * tile_size`` per dim when ``grid`` is given). With both ``grid``
    and ``element_shape`` omitted, the single tile is element-addressable so a
    subsequent ``.data`` covers the whole tile; pass ``grid=(1, 1, ...)`` instead to
    keep tile-level navigation granularity.

    """alloc_blocks(tile_size, block_size, grid=None, buffer_type=None, dtype=None, element_shape=None) -> NDSlice

    Allocate a fresh block-structured SBUF or HBM buffer and return an ``NDSlice``
    whose tiles are grouped into blocks.

    This is the block-view counterpart of ``alloc_tiles``: because the result is a
    block view, a whole block is written back in a single coalesced DMA once it has
    been accumulated.

    .. warning::

       This API is experimental and may change in future releases.

    Args:
        tile_size (tuple[int, ...]): The per-tile shape (at least 2-D), positive ints.
            Dimension 0 maps to the SBUF partition (P) axis.
        block_size (tuple[int, ...]): The number of tiles per block, the same rank as
            ``tile_size`` (an exact equality here -- unlike ``nt.blocks()`` on a raw
            source, which only requires the block rank not to exceed the source rank),
            positive ints.
        grid (tuple[int, ...] | None): The block-grid shape. Mutually exclusive with
            ``element_shape``.
        buffer_type (nl.MemoryRegion): ``nl.sbuf`` / ``nl.shared_hbm`` /
            ``nl.private_hbm``. Required. ``nl.psum`` is rejected.
        dtype: The element data type. Required.
        element_shape (tuple[int, ...] | None): The exact logical extent per dimension.
            Mutually exclusive with ``grid``.

    Returns:
        NDSlice: A block-grid view over the freshly allocated buffer (its tiles grouped
        into blocks) -- see ``NDSlice`` for the view's attributes. A whole block can be
        written back in one coalesced DMA once it is accumulated.

    Raises ``AssertionError`` in any of these cases:

    - any ``alloc_tiles`` rule is violated (missing ``buffer_type`` / ``dtype``,
      ``nl.psum``, both ``grid`` and ``element_shape``, or a ``tile_size`` /
      ``grid`` / ``element_shape`` shape error).
    - ``block_size`` is not a >= 2-D positive-int tuple.
    - ``block_size`` rank does not equal ``tile_size`` rank.

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            # 4x2 block grid of 2x2-tile blocks, 128x512 tiles, in SBUF.
            out = nt.alloc_blocks(tile_size=(128, 512), block_size=(2, 2), grid=(4, 2),
                                  buffer_type=nl.sbuf, dtype=nl.bfloat16)

    Sizing: grid versus element_shape
    ---------------------------------
    ``grid`` is the block grid, so the tile grid is ``grid * block_size``.
    ``element_shape`` is the exact extent, ceiling-divided first into the tile grid and
    then into the block grid. With both omitted, the result is a single-block
    allocation. The SBUF / HBM physical backing follows the ``alloc_tiles`` rules (see
    its *Memory layout*).

        alloc_tiles: allocate a tile buffer with no block grouping.

    """view_like(src, storage, dtype=None) -> NDSlice

    View caller-owned SBUF ``storage`` with ``src``'s logical tile structure. No data is
    moved and no memory is allocated.

    This is how one buffer serves regions of differing extent. ``alloc_tiles`` fixes the
    extent at allocation, so a buffer sized for the largest region reports that size for
    every region it later holds -- including a shorter one, whose trailing partial tile
    would then claim to be full. ``view_like`` states the extent per use instead, so a
    rotating buffer can back a short trailing block without a second allocation and
    without padding a compute operand.

    .. warning::

       This API is experimental and may change in future releases.

    Args:
        src (NDSlice): The tiled view whose ``element_shape`` and ``tile_size`` to mirror.
            Required.
        storage (nl.NkiTensor | NDSlice): Flat 2-D SBUF storage to view, at least as large
            as ``src``'s extent needs (the sizing ``alloc_tiles`` performs). An ``NDSlice``
            is accepted for convenience -- its underlying buffer is used, not its extent.
            Required.
        dtype: Element dtype. Defaults to ``storage``'s.

    Returns:
        NDSlice: An SBUF view over ``storage``, addressed by tile coordinate exactly as
        ``src`` is. A partial trailing tile reports its own extent.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If ``src`` is not a tiled ``NDSlice``, if ``storage`` is not flat
            2-D SBUF, or if ``storage`` is too small for ``src``'s extent.

    Example:
        2880 rows in blocks of 16 tiles of ``(128, 128)``: block 0 covers 2048 rows, the
        trailing block only 832. One slot serves both::
