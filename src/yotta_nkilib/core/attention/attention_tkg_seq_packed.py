    This kernel consumes canonical sequence IDs, precomputed Q indexing, packed
    block routing, and prepacked attention masks. Optional hardware-ready
    accumulator routing tables enable row-local associative accumulation
    without specializing the compiled kernel to one schedule. Active K/V
    values are selected from canonical sequence IDs and folded once per
    sequence at finalization. It supports block KV cache and LNC1/LNC2 batch
    sharding only, and can optionally fuse RoPE.

    See sequence_packing_design_spec.md in this directory for the schedule
    invariant, the metadata contract with a worked example, the accumulator
    merge, the padding contract, and the current limitations.

    Please refer to attention_tkg_torch.attention_tkg_torch for the attention math.

                  Expects:

                    - EXP_SUM: Result of sum(exp(QK)).
                    - ACTIVE_TABLE: (only use with block KV) Result after loading the active blocks table.
                  See implementation for shapes of these tensors.
      dtype_mode: Quantization dtype policy for the SBUF K/V tile allocations.
                  When ``k_prior.dtype`` / ``v_prior.dtype`` is concrete
                  (``nl.float8_e4m3`` or ``nl.float8_e4m3fn``), the kernel uses
                  it directly. When the caller leaves the dtype as the opaque
                  ``"float8e4"`` sentinel, ``dtype_mode`` selects the variant:
                  ``NON_OCP`` → ``nl.float8_e4m3``, ``OCP`` → ``nl.float8_e4m3fn``,
                  ``AUTO`` → ``nl.float8_e4m3fn`` on TRN3 else ``nl.float8_e4m3``.
                  Compiler enforces a single E4M3 variant per traced module
                  (``EOCP001``); pick one variant for the whole call graph.
      accumulator_partial_route_table: Optional Tensor-Indirection offsets that

                                       dtype uint16.
      accumulator_group_state_route_table: Optional Tensor-Indirection offsets
                                           for gathering and scattering the
                                           persistent state of each group.
                                           Same shape and dtype as the partial
                                           route. Both routes are reused
                                           independently for max, sum, and PV.

    Returns:
      out: Attention output tensor.
        Shape: if cfg.out_in_sb:
                [d, B * H * s_active] (indexing: [d, b * H * s_active+ h * s_active + s])
              else:
                [B, H, d, s_active]
      k_out: Key output tensor.
        Shape: if cfg.k_out_in_sb:
                [d, B * s_active] (indexing [d, b * s_active + s])
              else:
                [B, 1, d, s_active]

    FEATURES:

    1. Flexible Tensor Placement:
      - q, k, k_out, and out tensors can be placed in either SBUF or HBM
      - When qk_in_sb=True, q and k tensors are pre-loaded in SBUF (required for block KV cache)
      - out_in_sb and k_out_in_sb flags control output tensor placement for reduced memory transfers
      - Use this feature for performance improvement when integrating this kernel into a larger kernel

    2. Batch-only LNC2 Sharding:
      - LNC1 runs the full batch on one NeuronCore
      - LNC2 assigns each NeuronCore a disjoint, equally sized batch slice
      - Sequence sharding is not supported for packed attention

    3. Packed Mask Loading:
      - Each physical schedule row has a pre-aligned mask for all compute slots
      - Sequence and tile routing, including terminal active tokens, is encoded by the caller

    4. Fused RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding):
      - fuse_rope integrates RoPE computation directly into the attention kernel
      - Applies rotary embeddings to Q and K tensors, scaling Q by 1/sqrt(d_head)
      - Reduces memory traffic by avoiding separate RoPE passes

    5. Block KV Cache:
      - Supports block-sparse KV cache with configurable block_len
      - Uses active_blocks_table to track which cache blocks are active per batch
      - Enables efficient long-context inference with sparse memory access patterns

    6. K_prior Transpose Handling:
      - Block KV requires tp_k_prior=True
      - K_prior is [num_blocks, block_len, d] and is transposed during block loading

    7. Strided Memory Access (strided_mm1):
      - Enables strided read patterns for K in first matmul
      - When enabled, allows MM2 to use sequential V reads for better DMA throughput
      - Trades off MM1 memory access for MM2 optimization

    8. Attention Sink:
      - Supports streaming attention with sink tokens for infinite context
      - Sink tokens maintain fixed attention scores across all positions
      - Folds each sink once into persistent softmax state after all packed rows

    9. GPSIMD SBUF-to-SBUF Transfers:
      - use_gpsimd_sb2sb enables high-performance GPSIMD instructions for inter-core communication
      - Optimizes LNC2 sharding by using extended instructions for SBUF-to-SBUF data transfers

    10. Context Length Management:
      - curr_sprior: Current prior sequence length (actual KV cache content for this invocation)
      - full_sprior: Full prior sequence length (maximum KV cache capacity allocated)
      - Allows progressive filling of KV cache during autoregressive generation

    11. Stack-based SBUF Allocation:
      - Uses SbufManager for efficient on-chip memory management
      - Hierarchical scoping with interleave_degree for multi-bank utilization
      - Automatic alignment and temporary buffer lifecycle management

    IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

      The kernel goes through the following steps:
        -1. Setup of intermediate buffers, mask, block KV, and debug tensors.
         0. Perform rope if fuse_rope is set
         1. Performs the KQ^T computation.
          - Loop over each batch
          - Load the current chunk of K based on configuration (block KV, transpose, etc.)
          - Tile over the multiplication of K and Q in groups of 4k size
         2. Compute the max reduction of KQ^T computation.
          - Compute the max in tiles of size 128 over bs * q_head * s_active
          - Prepare the sink if used
          - Transpose and broadcast along the partition dimension
         3. Compute Exp(KQ^T - max(KQ^T))
          - Add/subtract the max based on whether it was negated
          - Apply the exponentiation activation
         4. Compute sum reduction of the exponentiation result
          - Compute the sum in tiles of size 128 over bs * q_head * s_active
          - Perform additional reductions based on sink or other optimization flags
          - Compute the reciprocal with the same tiling scheme, and then broadcast
         5. Compute the product of the above and V and store the result
          - Loop over each batch
          - Load the current chunk of V based on configuration (same as step 1)
          - Perform the matmul over sprior tiles
          - If needed, copy information over core boundaries or to HBM

    INTENDED USAGE:

      This kernel is optimized for cases when there are few active tokens.
      Use with s_active <= 7, and with d_head <= 128.

    Notes:
        - KV cache can have batch size larger than B (denoted B+) for garbage data buffering
        - Q is scaled with 1/sqrt(d_head) only when cfg.fuse_rope is True
        - Block KV cache requires qk_in_sb=True
        - LNC2 uses batch sharding and requires B to divide evenly across logical NCs
        - Packed schedules require an even number of compute slots per NC
        - Extended GPSIMD instructions require 16-partition alignment

    - running_sum: sum over local tiles of exp(qk - local_max).

        1. Save local_max to a scope-local buffer (used as prev for the correction factor).
        2. If sink is used: load sink into a scope-local buffer via _prep_sink.

        4. Rescale running_output by correction_factor (transpose_broadcast to [d_head,
           s_active_bqh]); running_sum is already at global scale from step 3.

    For packed batch-owned execution, sink is folded once into the persistent
    running state after every schedule row has accumulated. Then normalize
    running_output by reciprocal(running_sum) and store.

    dma_copy with a [128, N] vector_offset reads indices in a "snake" pattern (column-major):
    all 128 partitions' element 0, then all 128 partitions' element 1, etc. To ensure each
    partition gets its own N fold indices correctly, the SBUF index table must be pre-arranged
    into this snake layout.

    Approach: write SBUF to HBM with groups deinterleaved (AP-based), then dma_transpose reads
    each group's block column-major back into SBUF — producing the snake layout in one efficient
    DMA transfer (vs. the old 2-dma_copy approach which used a strided AP for the read-back).

        Group 1: p0=[10,11,12,13], p1=[110,111,112,113], ...

      HBM reshaped as [num_groups*N=8, P=8] for dma_transpose:
        row 0 (g0,f0): [  0,  1,  2,  3,100,101,102,103]
        row 1 (g0,f1): [200,201,202,203,300,301,302,303]

        p1: [  1,201,401,601, 11,211,411,611]
