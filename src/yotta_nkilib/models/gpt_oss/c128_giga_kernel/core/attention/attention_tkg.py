    Please refer to attention_tkg_torch.attention_tkg_torch for an equivalent torch implementation.

    NOTE: KV cache can have a batch size larger than B when kernel caller decides to add an extra buffer batch
    to KV cache to write garbage data. This is irrelevant to kernel impl which strictly uses the first B batches from
    KV cache in all cases. This is denoted as B+ in the shapes below.

    Dimensions:
        B: Batch size
        H: Number of query heads
        d: Head dimension
        s_active: Active sequence length (current tokens being processed)
        s_prior: Prior sequence length (KV cache length)
        block_len: Block length for block KV cache
        block_count: Number of blocks in KV cache

    Args:
      q: Query tensor. NOTE: Q is scaled with 1/sqrt(d_head) iff. cfg.fuse_rope!
        Shape: if cfg.qk_in_sb:
                [d, B * H * s_active] (indexing: [d, b * H * s_active+ h * s_active + s])
              else:
                [B, d, H, s_active]
      k_active: Active key tensor.
        Shape:  if cfg.qk_in_sb:
                  [d, B * s_active] (indexing: [d, b * s_active + s])
                else:
                  [B, d, s_active]
      v_active: Active value tensor. Shape [B, 1, s_active, d]
      k_prior: Prior key tensor from KV cache. Shape [B+, 1, s_prior, d] if cfg.tp_k_prior else [B+, 1, d, s_prior].
               For block KV cache, shape is [B+ * block_count, block_len, d] (indexing: [b * block_count + blk, block_len, d])
               For block KV cache with fp8_packed, shape is [B+ * block_count, block_len // 2, d, 2] fp8
      v_prior: Prior value tensor from KV cache. Shape [B+, 1, s_prior, d].
               For block KV cache, shape is [B+ * block_count, block_len, d] (indexing: [b * block_count + blk, block_len, d])
      mask: Attention mask. Shape depends on cfg.use_pos_id and the QK-swap decision:
              - cfg.use_pos_id=True: the active mask [s_active, B, H, s_active].
              - cfg.use_pos_id=False (pre-generated full mask): the layout MUST match the QK-swap
                decision. Call is_qk_swapped(...) (see attention_tkg_utils) first to determine which
                path this config takes, then supply the matching layout:
                  * default (K-stationary): [s_prior, B, H, s_active]
                  * QK-swap (Q-stationary): [B, H, s_active, s_prior]
                gen_mask_tkg_hbm produces the correct layout when given the same transposed_out flag.
      out: Output tensor.

      cfg: Kernel configuration with shapes and performance flags. See `AttnTKGConfig`
      sbm: SBUF memory manager for allocating temporary buffers
      inv_freqs: Inverse frequencies for RoPE. Shape [d // 2, 1]. Required when cfg.fuse_rope is True
      rope_pos_ids: Position IDs for RoPE. Shape [B, s_active]. Required when cfg.fuse_rope or cfg.use_pos_id is True
      start_pos_ids: Per-query SWA window start positions. Shape [B, s_active]. Optional.
                    When None, standard attention (full context) is used.
                    When provided, per-query sliding window attention mask is generated.
      sink: Sink attention tokens. Shape [H, 1] for streaming attention sink tokens
      active_blocks_table: Table of active blocks for block KV cache. Shape [B, num_blocks].
                          Required when using block KV cache
      k_out: Output key tensor after RoPE. Populated when cfg.fuse_rope is True, stores k_active after applying RoPE
        Shape: if cfg.k_out_in_sb:
                [d, B * s_active] (indexing [d, b * s_active + s])
              else:
                [B, 1, d, s_active].
      cp_softmax_stats_out: Output dict for exporting local softmax statistics.
                        Used by attention_block_tkg kernel with context parallel (CP > 1) for
                        distributed softmax correction. Caller provides pre-allocated tensors;
                        the kernel writes results into them.
                        Caller-provided keys:
                        - "fa_running_max" (nl.NkiTensor): Local softmax max.
                          Shape [s_active_bqh_tile, n_bsq_tiles].
                        - "fa_running_sum" (nl.NkiTensor): Local softmax sum of exp values.
                          Shape [s_active_bqh_tile, n_bsq_tiles].
                        Kernel-added keys:
                        - "max_negated" (bool): Whether max values are negated. Caller must pass
                          this to the CP correction to select the correct reduction op.
                        - "atp" (AttnTileParams): Tile parameters needed for broadcasting stats.
                        - "TC" (TileConstants): Tile constants needed for broadcasting stats.
                        Only populated when cfg.return_cp_softmax_stats=True.
      DBG_TENSORS: Optional tuple of 4-5 debug tensors with shared HBM type for intermediate value inspection.
                  Expects:
                    - QK: Result of Q@K^T.
                    - QK_MAX: Result of max reduction of QK.
                    - QK_EXP: Result of exp(QK).
                    - EXP_SUM: Result of sum(exp(QK)).
                    - ACTIVE_TABLE: (only use with block KV) Result after loading the active blocks table.
                  See implementation for shapes of these tensors.
      max_context_len: Optional scalar tensor for dynamic FA early exit. Shape [1], dtype int32.
                      When provided, the FA loop exits early after processing ceil(max_context_len / tile_size)
                      tiles instead of all tiles. Requires block KV cache and use_pos_id=True.
      dtype_mode: Quantization dtype policy for the SBUF K/V tile allocations.
                  When ``k_prior.dtype`` / ``v_prior.dtype`` is concrete
                  (``nl.float8_e4m3`` or ``nl.float8_e4m3fn``), the kernel uses
                  it directly. When the caller leaves the dtype as the opaque
                  ``"float8e4"`` sentinel, ``dtype_mode`` selects the variant:
                  ``NON_OCP`` → ``nl.float8_e4m3``, ``OCP`` → ``nl.float8_e4m3fn``,
                  ``AUTO`` → ``nl.float8_e4m3fn`` on TRN3 else ``nl.float8_e4m3``.
                  Compiler enforces a single E4M3 variant per traced module
                  (``EOCP001``); pick one variant for the whole call graph.
      schedule_handles: Optional dictionary populated with instruction handles
                        needed for explicit caller-side scheduling dependencies.

    Returns:
      out: Attention output tensor.
        Shape: if cfg.out_in_sb:
                [d, B * H * s_active] (indexing: [d, b * H * s_active+ h * s_active + s])
              else:
                [B, H, d, s_active]
        When cp_softmax_stats_out is provided, out is unnormalized
        (not divided by softmax_sum). Caller handles global normalization after CP correction.
      k_out: Key output tensor.
        Shape: if cfg.k_out_in_sb:
                [d, B * s_active] (indexing [d, b * s_active + s])
              else:
                [B, 1, d, s_active]

    FEATURES:

    1. Flexible Tensor Placement:
      - q, k, k_out, and out tensors can be placed in either SBUF or HBM
      - When qk_in_sb=True, q and k tensors are pre-loaded in SBUF (required for block KV cache)
      - out_in_sb and k_out_in_sb flags control output tensor placement for reduced memory transfers
      - Use this feature for performance improvement when integrating this kernel into a larger kernel

    2. Adaptive LNC2 Sharding:
      - Automatically selects sharding strategy based on tensor dimensions
      - Batch sharding: Used when batch is even AND (s_prior < 256 OR b*q_head*s_active > 128)
      - Sequence sharding: Used when s_prior >= 256 and batch sharding criteria not met
      - Balances computation across 2 NeuronCores for improved throughput

    3. Mask Generation:
      - use_pos_id=False: Pre-generated mask loaded from HBM
      - use_pos_id=True: Mask generated in-kernel from position IDs
      - In-kernel generation reduces memory bandwidth but requires position ID input

    4. Fused RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding):
      - fuse_rope integrates RoPE computation directly into the attention kernel
      - Applies rotary embeddings to Q and K tensors, scaling Q by 1/sqrt(d_head)
      - Reduces memory traffic by avoiding separate RoPE passes

    5. Block KV Cache:
      - Supports block-sparse KV cache with configurable block_len
      - Uses active_blocks_table to track which cache blocks are active per batch
      - Enables efficient long-context inference with sparse memory access patterns

    6. K_prior Transpose Handling:
      - tp_k_prior flag indicates whether the kernel needs to transpose K_prior during load
      - Flat KV:
        - True: K_prior is [B, 1, s_prior, d] in HBM, kernel transposes to [d, s_prior] in SBUF
        - False: K_prior is [B, 1, d, s_prior] in HBM, kernel loads directly (already transposed)
      - Block KV: must be True. K_prior is [num_blocks, block_len, d], kernel always transposes during block loading

    7. Strided Memory Access (strided_mm1):
      - Enables strided read patterns for K in first matmul
      - When enabled, allows MM2 to use sequential V reads for better DMA throughput
      - Trades off MM1 memory access for MM2 optimization

    8. Attention Sink:
      - Supports streaming attention with sink tokens for infinite context
      - Sink tokens maintain fixed attention scores across all positions
      - Integrated into softmax reduction for minimal overhead

    9. GPSIMD SBUF-to-SBUF Transfers:
      - use_gpsimd_sb2sb enables high-performance GPSIMD instructions for inter-core communication
      - Optimizes LNC2 sharding by using extended instructions for SBUF-to-SBUF data transfers

    10. Context Length Management:
      - curr_sprior: Current prior sequence length (actual KV cache content for this invocation)
      - full_sprior: Full prior sequence length (maximum KV cache capacity allocated)
      - Allows progressive filling of KV cache during autoregressive generation

    11. Stack-based SBUF Allocation:
      - Uses SbufManager for efficient on-chip memory management
      - Hierarchical scoping with interleave_degree for multi-bank utilization
      - Automatic alignment and temporary buffer lifecycle management

    IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

      The kernel goes through the following steps:
        -1. Setup of intermediate buffers, mask, block KV, and debug tensors.
         0. Perform rope if fuse_rope is set
         1. Performs the KQ^T computation.
          - Loop over each batch
          - Load the current chunk of K based on configuration (block KV, transpose, etc.)
          - Tile over the multiplication of K and Q in groups of 4k size
         2. Compute the max reduction of KQ^T computation.
          - Compute the max in tiles of size 128 over bs * q_head * s_active
          - Prepare the sink if used
          - Transpose and broadcast along the partition dimension
         3. Compute Exp(KQ^T - max(KQ^T))
          - Add/subtract the max based on whether it was negated
          - Apply the exponentiation activation
         4. Compute sum reduction of the exponentiation result
          - Compute the sum in tiles of size 128 over bs * q_head * s_active
          - Perform additional reductions based on sink or other optimization flags
          - Compute the reciprocal with the same tiling scheme, and then broadcast
         5. Compute the product of the above and V and store the result
          - Loop over each batch
          - Load the current chunk of V based on configuration (same as step 1)
          - Perform the matmul over sprior tiles
          - If needed, copy information over core boundaries or to HBM

    INTENDED USAGE:

      This kernel is optimized for cases when there are few active tokens.
      Use with s_active <= 7, and with d_head <= 512.

    Notes:
        - KV cache can have batch size larger than B (denoted B+) for garbage data buffering
        - Q is scaled with 1/sqrt(d_head) only when cfg.fuse_rope is True
        - Block KV cache requires qk_in_sb=True
        - LNC2 sharding automatically selected based on tensor dimensions
        - Extended GPSIMD instructions require 16-partition alignment

    SBUF Internal Layouts (d-tiling, d_head > 128):
        When d_head > p_max (128), the head dimension is tiled into n_d_tiles = ceil(d_head/128) chunks.
        Key SBUF buffers use a packed layout with d-tiles concatenated along the free dimension:

        k_sb:  [d_tile_size, n_d_tiles * s_prior_tile]
               Each d-tile's K data occupies [d_tile_size, s_prior_tile] at offset i_d * s_prior_tile.
        qk:    [s_prior_tile, s_active_bqh]
               QK^T accumulates across d-tiles in PSUM; final shape is independent of n_d_tiles.
        exp_v (res): [d_tile_size, n_d_tiles * s_active_bqh]
               PV matmul output per d-tile at offset i_d * s_active_bqh.
        out (if out_in_sb): [d_tile_size, n_d_tiles * bs_full * s_active_qh]
               Final output in tiled layout; each d-tile at offset i_d * bs_full * s_active_qh.
        out (if HBM): [B, H, d_head, s_active]
               Stored per d-tile via strided DMA: slice(2, i_d*d_tile_size, (i_d+1)*d_tile_size).

        When d_head <= 128 (n_d_tiles == 1), all offsets are 0 and shapes collapse to the non-tiled case.

    dst_u32 is a [p_max, num_columns] uint32 gather-index table produced by a plain tensor_copy from
    signed_table, which maps every inactive-block sentinel (INACTIVE_BLOCK_IDX = -1, subdivided by
    block resize into {-rf, ..., -1}) to 0. Since the block-KV loads use dma_transpose (which cannot
    use oob_mode.skip), those padding gathers are still issued; leaving them all at 0 makes every
    inactive slot read block 0, and at partial cache the inactive columns all collide on the same
    128-block window in HBM, throttling DMA.

    For each inactive slot, generate:
        partition_id + (column % valid_iota_columns) * p_max
    where valid_iota_columns is the number of whole p_max columns that fit in the physical cache.
    This spreads padding gathers across distinct physical blocks before repeating the pattern.
    signed_table carries the sentinels (negative values); dst_u32 receives the generated indices.
    Both fold-major and batch-major index tables use the same pattern.

    num_resized_physical_blocks has the following implications:
      - It is the physical cache block count after block resizing, including the resize factor applied
        to both the cache and active block indices.
      - The physical cache can still contain fewer blocks than the logical table, so an iota spanning
        all table columns can generate out-of-bounds indices.
      - The largest whole-p_max range that fits both the physical cache and this table is used, then
        repeated across the remaining columns. This maximizes distinct aligned block indices before
        repetition while keeping every generated index below num_resized_physical_blocks.
      - For a non-p_max-aligned cache, up to p_max - 1 tail blocks are intentionally unused to avoid
        partial-column remapping.
      - If the cache has fewer than p_max blocks, inactive entries retain the original cast-to-zero
        result.
      - The iota's zero-stride outer dimension repeats the range to a whole-pattern column count, and
        the source is sliced back to num_columns before the predicated copy.

    On the last FA tile, the s_active most-recent tokens (being generated) must be written into
    k_sb at the tail of the last fold. The source is bufs.k_active_sb [d_head, bs_full * s_active].

    Structure:
      - Flat KV: simple tail copy into k_sb.
      - Block KV: active tokens span num_blks_covering_s_active blocks at the end of the last fold.
        extra_covered = how many positions in the first covered block are prior cache (not active).
        Three sub-paths based on dtype and qk_row_tile_factor:

        1. fp8_packed (any qk_row_tile_factor): per-token copy into a 4D permuted fp8 view of k_sb.
           Uses _k_tile_physical_index for bh_idx to handle kbld-outer interleaving.
           Partition-half selection for qk_row_tile_factor=2 uses quarter-based addressing.

        2. Non-fp8, qk_row_tile_factor=1: bulk copy when no batching (last fold contiguous),
           per-token via _k_tile_physical_index when batching (kbld-outer interleaved).

        3. Non-fp8, qk_row_tile_factor=2: per-token copy with even/odd partition-half selection.
           Even seq positions → partitions 0:d_head, odd → d_head:128.

    All block-KV paths account for DMA batching layout (kbld-outer interleaving) when computing
    physical offsets into k_sb.

    dma_copy with a [128, N] vector_offset reads indices in a "snake" pattern (column-major):
    all 128 partitions' element 0, then all 128 partitions' element 1, etc. To ensure each
    partition gets its own N fold indices correctly, the SBUF index table must be pre-arranged
    into this snake layout.

    Approach: write SBUF to HBM with groups deinterleaved (AP-based), then dma_transpose reads
    each group's block column-major back into SBUF — producing the snake layout in one efficient
    DMA transfer (vs. the old 2-dma_copy approach which used a strided AP for the read-back).

        Group 1: p0=[10,11,12,13], p1=[110,111,112,113], ...

      HBM reshaped as [num_groups*N=8, P=8] for dma_transpose:
