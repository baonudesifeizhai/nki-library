"""Fused RMSNorm + MX-quantization (+ optional router top-K) in token-major [T, H] layout (prefill).


Memory:
    SBUF is allocated explicitly via ``SbufManager`` to control buffer placement and break
    anti-dependencies. Two principles:
      - Cross-tile: the per-tile scope is opened with ``interleave_degree=4`` + ``increment_section()``
        per iteration, so consecutive tiles use distinct SBUF address sets -- tile N+k's DMA load
        overlaps tile N's compute. (degree 1->4 took the H=3072/E=128 target ~450M to ~326M cycles;
        degree 5 reached ~311M but is the SBUF-max there, so 4 is used to keep headroom for larger E/H.)
      - Intra-tile: the inner k/buf loops (swizzle, spill) ``alloc_stack`` a FRESH address each
        iteration (no per-iteration scope), so no inner buffer is overwritten while still being read
        (zero intra-tile WAR), and all free together at the tile section rotation.
    The spill coalesces all per-k transposed blocks into one staging buffer per region and issues a
    SINGLE wide DMA each (vs num_H512 tiny 512 B stores). Loop-invariants (gamma_bc, biases, router
    weights, expert iota) live in the outer scope. PSUM is allocated directly (SbufManager is SBUF-only).

Flow per token tile (always processes a full 128-partition tile; partial tiles pad to 128, store n_tok):
    1. plain DMA load HBM [T, H] -> [128, H] bf16
    2. fused norm+transpose, split so transpose/router don't wait on the full-H reduction
       (inv_rms[t] is a per-token scalar constant across h, so it factors out of both):
       PASS 1 per H512 block: accumulate sum-of-squares; apply GAMMA ONLY; FP32-packed
         swizzle-transpose -> persistent swizzled bf16 (qmx layout); (optional) router matmul.
       between: inv_rms = rsqrt(ss/unpadded_hidden_size + eps); build inv_rms_swz via a PE transpose-broadcast.
       PASS 2 per H512 block: scale swizzled by inv_rms (bf16-view mul); quantize_mx.
    3. (optional) router top-K (scale logits by inv_rms first) + activation + scatter
    4. transpose quant back to token-major and spill packed [T, H + scale_region] to HBM

Constraints: H a multiple of 512; Trn3+ only (quantize_mx is NeuronCore-v4).

        B: batch, S: sequence, T = B*S tokens
        H: hidden dim (multiple of 512); E: experts (<= 512); K: top_k (<= 8)
        H0 = 128 partition fold, num_H512 = H/512, q_width = 4

    Args:
        hidden_states (nl.NkiTensor): [B, S, H] bf16 input on HBM. H order is set by hidden_interleaved:
            False (default) = NATURAL H (not permuted); True = 4-way interleaved. Either way the caller
            does NOT apply the internal swizzle -- the kernel does that during the FP32-packed transpose.
        gamma (nl.NkiTensor): [1, H] or [H] RMSNorm weights on HBM. Always NATURAL H order, independent of
            hidden_interleaved (the kernel de-interleaves hidden_states during the load); not swizzled.
        router_weights (nl.NkiTensor): [H, E] router weights PRE-PERMUTED into the kernel's internal
            swizzle H order on HBM. If None, the router is skipped and only the packed quant tensor is
            returned.

            Why the permute: the router matmul runs against the swizzle-TRANSPOSED activations (the same
            transpose quantize_mx needs), whose partition axis is the swizzled H index
            h_swz = h512*512 + 4*p + q (h512 = H512-block, p = 0..127 partition, q = 0..3 lane) -- NOT
            natural h. To make logits = sum_h norm[t,h] * W[h,e] come out right, row h of the natural
            weight must be placed at swizzle slot h_swz. Equivalently, build the permuted weight as
            W_perm[swizzle_slot] = W[swizzle_h_index[swizzle_slot]].

            Reference swizzle (offline host weight-prep):

                def swizzle_h_index(H):                  # swizzle slot -> original H index
                    num_h512 = H // 512
                    h512 = torch.arange(num_h512).reshape(num_h512, 1, 1)
                    q    = torch.arange(4).reshape(1, 4, 1)
                    p    = torch.arange(128).reshape(1, 1, 128)
                    return (h512 * 512 + 4 * p + q).reshape(-1)   # shape [H]

                router_weights_permuted = natural_router_weights[swizzle_h_index(H)]   # [H, E]

            For router_act_fn == NOAUX_TC, the SAME swizzle-permute applies -- the noaux_tc
            router still scores against the swizzle-transposed activations, so its weight must be permuted
            the same way.
        router_bias (nl.NkiTensor): [1, E] or [E] optional router bias on HBM. For NOAUX_TC this is the
            e_score_correction_bias (added to the sigmoid scores for group/expert SELECTION only; the
            returned affinity is normalized from the PRE-bias sigmoid scores). Required for NOAUX_TC.
        eps (float): epsilon for numerical stability.
        top_k (int): number of experts to select per token (<= 8). Only used when router_weights set.
        router_act_fn (RouterActFnType): SIGMOID, SOFTMAX, or NOAUX_TC. Only used when router_weights set.
            NOAUX_TC - group-limited router (see n_group/topk_group/routed_scaling_factor)
            and emits ONLY the dense fp32 expert_affinities [T, E] (no expert_index tensor); these may
            be packed into the row tail via pack_affinities (as fp32) like the top-K path.
        n_group (int): NOAUX_TC only. Number of expert groups (E must be divisible by n_group; <= 8 for
            the max8-based per-group selection). Ignored for SIGMOID/SOFTMAX.
        topk_group (int): NOAUX_TC only. Number of groups kept after group-level gating (<= 8). Ignored
            for SIGMOID/SOFTMAX.
        routed_scaling_factor (float): NOAUX_TC only. Final multiplier on the L1-normalized top-k
            affinities. Ignored for SIGMOID/SOFTMAX.
        qmx_output_dtype: packed MX output dtype (float8_e4m3fn_x4 default).
        pack_scales (bool): controls how the per-block MX scales are laid out in the scale region of
            each packed output row. quantize_mx emits one uint8 scale per (32-partition quadrant x
            4-lane) group, so each H512 tile produces scales that only occupy 4 of every 32 columns
            after transpose -- 7/8 of an unfolded scale tile is wasted padding.
            - pack_scales=True (default, "folded"): pack 4 consecutive H512 tiles into one 128-wide
              block by shifting tile k into within-quadrant offset (k%4)*4. This reclaims the wasted
              columns, so scale_region = ceil(num_H512/4)*128 (roughly H/16 columns).
            - pack_scales=False ("unfolded"): one 128-wide block per H512 tile, no folding, so
              scale_region = num_H512*128 (= H/4 columns) -- ~4x larger
        pack_affinities (bool): router only. If True, the dense [T, E] expert affinities are
            concatenated into each packed row after the scale region (reinterpreted into the fp8 row at
            the affinity dtype -- bf16 for SIGMOID/SOFTMAX, fp32 for NOAUX_TC) instead of returned as a
            separate HBM tensor, so a downstream block gather pulls [hidden | scale | affinities] in one
            indirect DMA. The total row is padded to a multiple of 4 fp8 columns (the hidden region's
            fp32-reinterpret transpose requires it). The kernel then returns norm_quant_packed viewed as
            the affinity dtype (so the caller reads affinities directly; re-view to fp8 for hidden+scale).
            When False (default), expert_affinities is returned as its own [T, E] tensor (legacy layout).
        unpadded_hidden_size (int): actual (unpadded) hidden size for the RMS mean denominator. When the
            input H is zero-padded offline (e.g. up to a multiple of 512), the sum-of-squares is taken
            over the full padded H (the zero pad contributes 0), but the mean divides by unpadded_hidden_size
            so padding does not skew the norm. Defaults to H (no padding).
        residual (nl.NkiTensor): [B, S, H] optional residual on HBM. When set, the kernel adds it to
            hidden_states before RMSNorm (hidden = hidden_states + residual); the norm/quant/router
            all consume the sum. The pre-norm sum is also written out (output_residual) for the next
            layer's residual stream, in the SAME H order as the inputs (interleaved when
            hidden_interleaved) -- the model's residual stream is itself interleaved, so this hands it
            back ready to use. If None, no residual add is performed.
        emit_norm_bf16 (bool): when True, additionally return the token-major bf16 RMSNorm output
            norm_bf16 [T, H] = (hidden [+ residual]) * inv_rms * gamma, in NATURAL H order -- the same
            value a standalone RMSNorm produces. This lets one fused launch feed both the MX-quant
            consumers AND bf16 consumers (attention wq_a/wkv_a, the sparse indexer wk/weights_proj) that
            need the normed activation un-quantized. Computed fp32 and cast to bf16 on store (matches a
            torch RMSNorm reference); orthogonal to the router and to residual. Natural H even under
            hidden_interleaved (hidden_states is de-interleaved during the load).
        hidden_interleaved (bool): when True, hidden_states and residual arrive in the model's 4-way
            interleaved H order (stored[q*(H/4) + p] == natural[4*p + q]) instead of natural H. gamma
            stays natural H either way. Outputs match what each consumer wants: the packed MX row and
            norm_bf16 are natural H (they feed kernels), while output_residual comes back in the input's
            order (it feeds the model's own residual stream, which is interleaved).

    Returns:
        list of HBM tensors, always starting with norm_quant_packed (nl.NkiTensor): [T, row_region]
        fp8, where row_region = H + scale_region, or the affinity-padded H_load when pack_affinities
        (router only). Then appended in order when the corresponding input is set: expert_index
        [T,top_k] int32 (when router_weights is set), then expert_affinities [T,E] (when router_weights
        is set AND not pack_affinities -- when pack_affinities the affinities live inside the packed
        row, so no separate tensor is returned), then output_residual [T,H] (when residual is set),
        then norm_bf16 [T,H] bf16 (when emit_norm_bf16 is set).

    Pseudocode:
        for each token tile of 128 tokens (padded to 128, store n_tok):
            # 1. load [128, H] bf16 (+ optional residual add, also spilled to output_residual)
