    An instance of DimShard represents a shard on a specific dimension.  The members specific the shard region
    along with the associated kernels parameters.  shard_mlp_params is typically provided in this structure
    such that the sharded dimension size is specified as the size of the shard.  We do this with shard_mlp_params
    so that the most of the rest of the code can be written in a way that is agnostic to shard size, original tensor
    size, and whether or not sharding is even used.

    For example, assume we are sharding on the S dimension, the S dimension size is 1024, and our shard size is 512.
    Two instances of DimShard would represent this.  Instance #1 would have a dim_offset of 0, a dim_size of 512,
    and the S dimension size in shard_mlp_params would be set to 512.  Instance #2 would have a dim_offset of 512 (i.e.
    offset into the tensor by 512), a dim_size of 512, and the S dimension size in shard_mlp_params would be set to 512.
