DeepSeek-V3.2 LNC1-ONLY fork of the shared blockwise-MX MoE CTE kernel
(``core/moe/moe_cte/bwmm_shard_on_block_mx.py``).

Same math: blockwise matrix multiplication for Mixture of Experts (MoE) layers using MXFP4 or
MXFP8 quantization. Tokens are pre-assigned to fixed-size blocks; each block runs the full
gate/up -> activation -> down pipeline for its expert and accumulates into the output.

Why this fork exists
--------------------
The shared kernel is hard-wired to two logical Neuron cores: ``check_kernel_compatibility``
asserts ``num_shards == 2``, blocks are split across the two shards, output writes carry a
``shard_id * T * H`` offset into a ``[2, T, H]`` buffer, and the kernel closes with a
``core_barrier`` plus a cross-shard reduce that merges the two halves. DeepSeek-V3.2 w128 decode
runs at ``NEURON_LOGICAL_NC_CONFIG=1`` (one logical core), where that machinery is dead weight
at best and wrong at worst. Rather than thread an LNC1 special case through the shared kernel,
DS32 owns this dedicated single-core fork (plus the sibling ``_utils.py``).

What differs from the shared kernel
-----------------------------------
This is a MECHANICAL specialisation at ``num_shards == 1`` / ``shard_id == 0``, not a redesign:

* The entry asserts a single logical core (``get_program_sharding_info()`` -> ``n_prgs == 1``).
* All block-distribution arithmetic collapses: every block is processed by the one core, the
  static loop walks ``0 .. n_static_blocks - 1``, and the dynamic loops step the block index
  by 1 instead of by ``num_shards``.
* The odd-block-count "remainder + dummy block" load-balancing split is gone: with one core
  there is no peer to hand a dummy block to.
* The output is a plain ``[T, H]`` buffer written with no shard offset, and there is no closing
  barrier or shard reduce -- the single core's accumulation IS the final result.

MUST NOT be used at LNC2. With two cores both would redundantly compute every block and race on
the same un-offset output rows. Use ``core/moe/moe_cte/bwmm_shard_on_block_mx.py`` there.

    Blockwise MXFP MoE kernel, SINGLE LOGICAL CORE (LNC1) only. Use as standalone kernel.

    The blockwise matrix multiplication (matmul) kernel implements a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
    layer at a block granularity, offering an alternative to token dropping approaches.
    This method assumes that tokens have already been assigned to blocks, as specified
    by the user through the token_position_to_id parameter.
    This kernel loops over all blocks, without considering they are padded or non-padded blocks.
    Supports both MXFP4 and MXFP8 weight quantization.

    LNC1 ONLY: the kernel asserts a single logical Neuron core at entry. There is no
    block distribution across shards, no shard offset on the output (which is a plain
    [T, H] buffer), and no closing core_barrier / cross-shard reduce -- the one core's
    accumulation is the final result. Launching this at LNC2 fails the entry assert; use
    core/moe/moe_cte/bwmm_shard_on_block_mx.py for two cores.

    Intended Usage:
        - Block size B: 128-1024 tokens
        - Total tokens T: 32k
        - Hidden dimension H: 512-8192
        - Intermediate dimension I_TP: 384-3072
        - Number of experts E: 8-128

    Dimensions:
        H: Hidden dimension size
        T: Total number of input tokens (after linearizing across the batch dimension)
        B: Number of tokens per block
        N: Total number of blocks
        E: Number of experts
        I: Intermediate size / tp degree

    Args:
        hidden_states (nl.NkiTensor): Tensor of input hidden states on HBM of size (T+1, H). The reason it is T+1 is because padding token position is set to T.
                                       with skip_dma, id will be set to -1, so this shape can be (T, H). Similarly for expert_affinities_masked, output
        expert_affinities_masked (nl.NkiTensor): Tensor of expert affinities corresponding to each token of size ((T+1) * E, 1).
                                        TODO: cannot refactor to (T+1, E) as we currently don't support dynamic slice on both axis.
        gate_up_proj_weight (nl.NkiTensor): Tensor of concatenated gate and up projection weights on HBM (E, H, 2, I).
                                          Supports MXFP4 (nl.float4_e2m1fn_x4) and MXFP8 (nl.float8_e4m3fn_x4, nl.float8_e5m2_x4).
        down_proj_weight (nl.NkiTensor): Tensor of down projection weights on HBM (E, I, H).
                                       Supports MXFP4 (nl.float4_e2m1fn_x4) and MXFP8 (nl.float8_e4m3fn_x4, nl.float8_e5m2_x4).
        block_size (int): Number of tokens per block
        token_position_to_id (nl.NkiTensor): Tensor of block index of the corresponding tokens on HBM (N * B,)
                                          Note that we include tokens included for padding purposes and N * B >= T.
                                          For padding token, id is set to T. with skip_dma, id will be set to -1.
        block_to_expert (nl.NkiTensor): Tensor of expert indices of corresponding blocks on HBM (N, 1)

        num_static_block (int): Optional. Number of non-padded blocks if known (default: -1).
        n_dynamic_blocks (int): Number of blocks to process with dynamic loop when n_static_blocks
            is not specified (default: 55, empirically tuned for GPT-OSS).
        gate_and_up_proj_bias: nl.NkiTensor | None = None, Optional. A tensor of shape [E, 2, I].
                              Note that if activation function is Swiglu, we expect up_bias = up_bias + 1
        down_proj_bias: nl.NkiTensor | None = None. Optional argument. A tensor of shape [E, H]

        # Arguments for quantization scales
        gate_up_proj_scale: nl.NkiTensor | None = None. uint8 MX scales of shape
                            [E, _pmax // _q_height, 2, n_H512_tile, I] (standard layout) or

                            Under STATIC_MX it instead carries the per-expert gate/up weight
                            scales as fp32 [E, 2, 1] (idx 0 = gate, idx 1 = up).

    Load gate and up projection weights, scales, and biases for current expert.

    Loads MXFP4/MXFP8 quantized weights, uint8 scales, and biases for both gate and up
    projections from HBM to SBUF for the expert assigned to the current block.

    Args:
        inps (InputTensors): Input tensors containing gate_up_proj_weight of shape
            [E, 128, 2, n_H512_tile, I], gate_up_proj_scale, gate_and_up_proj_bias,
            and buffers for scales and index vectors.
        block_expert (nl.NkiTensor): Expert index for current block, shape [1, 1].
        dims (BWMMMXDimensionSizes): Dimension configuration with I, H.
        prj_cfg (ProjConfig): Projection configuration with n_H512_tile_sharded, I.
        skip_dma (SkipMode): DMA skip configuration for weight loading.

    Returns:
        tuple: (gup_weights_qtz_sbuf, gup_scales_sb, gup_bias_sbuf)
            - gup_weights_qtz_sbuf (nl.NkiTensor): Quantized weights [128, 2, n_H512_tile_sharded, I]
            - gup_scales_sb (nl.NkiTensor): Dequantization scales [128, 2, n_H512_tile_sharded, I]
            - gup_bias_sbuf (nl.NkiTensor): Bias values [128, 2, n_total_I512_tile, 128]

    Notes:
        - Uses indirect DGE with block_expert for expert selection
        - Generates index vectors on-the-fly for scale loading
        - Pads bias to 512 when I < 512 for alignment
        - Scales are loaded with zero-padding for out-of-bounds partitions
