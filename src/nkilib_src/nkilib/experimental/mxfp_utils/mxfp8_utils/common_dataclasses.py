    Descriptor for managing quantized tensor data and metadata.

    Encapsulates tensor data, quantization scales, and layout flags to track
    various transformations applied to tensors during computation.

    Can be constructed with data and optional scales:
        TensorDescriptor(data=tensor, scales=scales, is_swizzled=True, ...)
        If scales are provided, the tensor is treated as quantized and is_x4/is_swizzled
        are auto-detected. If unswizzled BF16, is_f_by_k is set automatically.

    Args:
        data (Optional[nl.NkiTensor]): Primary tensor data, None if not specified.
        scales (Optional[nl.NkiTensor]): Quantization scale factors, None if unquantized.
        is_swizzled (bool): True if tensor is in [P/4, F*4] swizzled format.
        orientation (Optional[TensorOrientation]): F_BY_K/K_BY_F, or None (unset).
            None resolves to F_BY_K for unswizzled BF16 and K_BY_F otherwise; explicit
            K_BY_F on an unswizzled BF16 tensor selects PE swizzle. The is_f_by_k
            property exposes the resolved bool for readers.
        is_x4 (bool): True if data is in _x4 packed format.
        scales_are_packed (bool): True if scales are packed.
        is_col_parallel_sharded (bool): True if tensor is sharded across 2 cores (LNC2).
        swizzle_mode (SwizzleMode): Conversion mechanism for unswizzled BF16.
            SwizzleMode.PE selects PE transpose (load_tile_PE_swizzle_wrapX) instead
            of DGT, and supports both direct (contiguous) and indirect (scattered)
            DMA modes; indirect mode is activated when indirect_dma_vector_offset is
            set. The load_with_PE_swizzle property is a read-only bool view of this.
        indirect_dma_vector_offset (Optional[nl.NkiTensor]): SBUF
            int32 tensor of shape (P_MAX, NUM_SUB_TILES) holding global F-row indices
            for indirect DMA gather when swizzle_mode is PE.
        psum_drain_engine_ratio (Tuple[int, int]): (num_scalar, num_vector) split of the
            PE swizzle PSUM copy-outs across the Scalar and Vector engines. Only applies
            when swizzle_mode is PE. Defaults to (1, 1) (alternate). Both entries
            must be >= 0 and at least one must be non-zero.
        scalar_offset (Optional[nl.NkiTensor]): Currently unsupported. Runtime scalar
            offset added to every DGT vector_offset entry for per-expert weight slicing.
            Must be float32 dtype, pre-scaled into vector_size units.
        effective_f_dim (Optional[int]): Currently unsupported. Per-expert logical F
            dimension for stacked-expert tensors to clamp DGT tile_f at expert boundaries.
        skip_dma (Optional[SkipMode]): Currently unsupported. Controls OOB handling for
            DMA operations. When skip_dma.skip_token is True, out-of-bounds indices are
            skipped via oob_mode.skip.
