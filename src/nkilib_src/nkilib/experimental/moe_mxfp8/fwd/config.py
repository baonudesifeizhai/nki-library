class MXFP8MOEFwdConfig(nl.NKIObject):
    """Configuration for the MXFP8 MoE forward pass kernel.

    Mirrors :class:`MXFP8MOEBwdConfig` so the forward and backward share the same
    tuning surface and stay symmetric. Groups the compute / sharding / affinity
    knobs plus the per-phase matmul blocking configs.

    The forward has only two matmul phases (gate_up and down), versus the
    backward's four, so it carries two per-phase configs.

    Args:
        compute_dtype (nki.dtype): Compute dtype for SBUF/HBM intermediates and
            the emitted activations/checkpoints (default: nl.bfloat16).
        fp8_x4_dtype (type): MXFP8 packed weight dtype (default: float8_e4m3fn_x4).
        activation_type (ActFnType): Gate activation (default: SiLU).
        shard_option (ShardOption): LNC2 sharding strategy. The forward kernel is
            built for SHARD_ON_BLOCK (each core owns a disjoint subset of the N
            blocks and writes its own output slab; slabs are reduced at the end).
        affinity_option (AffinityOption): Where the expert affinity scalar is
            folded into the FFN chain. Must match the backward's choice. The
            forward folds on the intermediate (AFFINITY_ON_I) so the pre-down
            value equals the scaled_intermediate checkpoint.
        gate_up_config (MatmulMxfp8KernelConfig): Matmul blocking for the gate/up
            projection. When None, a default with TILES_IN_BLOCK_*=1 is built.
        down_config (MatmulMxfp8KernelConfig): Matmul blocking for the down
            projection. When None, a default with TILES_IN_BLOCK_*=1 is built.
        is_tensor_update_accumulating (bool): When True (top_k > 1), the per-block
            output scatter does a read-modify-write so multiple experts touching
            the same token accumulate. When False (default, top_k == 1), it
            overwrites. Forced off on the single_expert_dense path.
        single_expert_dense (bool): When True (default), the kernel assumes hidden
            states are already packed for one expert and weights contain only that
            expert. Token gather, expert-indexed weight loads, affinity gather, and
            output scatter use contiguous direct addressing instead of indirect DMA.
            Routed (E > 1) callers must set this False, along with
            fast_dma_transpose / reuse_spilled_weights / use_1x32_pe_swizzle, which
            all require the dense path.
        clamp_limits (ClampLimits): Optional gate/up activation clamp limits.
            Applied BEFORE the gate_up checkpoint is written and BEFORE SiLU, so
            the checkpoint matches what the backward expects (it does not re-clamp).
        skip_dma (SkipMode): OOB handling for indirect-DMA token gather/scatter.
        bias (bool): Whether gate/up and down biases are added (reserved surface).
        checkpoint_config (MXFP8MOECheckpointConfig): Per-checkpoint save flags
            controlling which activation checkpoints the forward emits for the
            backward. When a checkpoint is disabled the forward skips computing +
            storing it (and the entry point does not allocate/return it).
        fast_dma_transpose (bool): When True, load the unswizzled-BF16 operands via
            the direct-4D-access-pattern DGT path (no vector_offset_pattern SBUF
            buffers) instead of the flatten + vector-offset path. The fast loader
            addresses the source as ``f_offset*K + k_offset`` and does NOT honor a
            per-expert ``scalar_offset``, so it is only valid on the
            ``single_expert_dense`` (E=1, contiguous) path; the dropless impl asserts
            this. Default False.
        reuse_spilled_weights (bool): When True, the quantized weight spill buffers
            are allocated once and reused across the block loop instead of rebuilt
            per block, so only the first block this core loads+quantizes the weights.
            Requires ``single_expert_dense`` (E=1); only affects phases whose
            ``spill_reload`` is on. Default False.
        use_1x32_pe_swizzle (bool): When True, load the unswizzled-BF16 operands via
            the 1x32 PE-swizzle FP32-reinterpret transpose (``load_tile_PE_Swizzle_1x32``)
            instead of the DGT / ``fast_dma_transpose`` path. Sets
            ``quant_scheme=_1x32`` + ``swizzle_mode=PE`` on all four operand TDs. Only
            valid on the ``single_expert_dense`` (E=1) path. Both GEMMs' contraction dims
            need only ``% 128 == 0`` (the flexible-K loader tiles K as 512 + a <512
            remainder), so H and I_TP need not be multiples of 512 — e.g. TP2's
            I_TP=768 works. Mutually exclusive with ``fast_dma_transpose``. Default
            False.
    Spill/reload and scale packing are per-phase: set them on gate_up_config /
    down_config (``spill_reload`` / ``enable_scale_packing``). Note a DGT autotune-cache
    hit can still override a phase's ``spill_reload``.
